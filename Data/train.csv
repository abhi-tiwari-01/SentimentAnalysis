Even organic farms spray pesticide its just made from soil bacteria instead of chemicals The commercial solutions also have a large coverage area per gallon Another benefit is it keeps humans further away from contact with the spray Dont we want robots to to the jobs that make us sick Im against glyphosate because its proven to cause cancer and stays in the soil 25 years or more gets into the streams and well water among other problems with it,negative

A drone that size could surely be fitted with a gasoline engine and larger chemical tank to save time on charging batteries every fifteen minutes or so Some of the big model aircraft being made these days could stay in the air for an hour or more without refueling and fitted with the same  electronics and bigger spray tank than a plastic battery powered drone,negative
Very good idea Plz release in India also,positive

All the clappie comments here have been uploaded by the mob that make and sell these electronic mosquitoes obviously   lol,negative
People are getting lazier and greedier it seems I love drones  especially on the sight of my boom stick   pesky things,negative
Ive got a drone that hunts pests and eradicates them at a fraction of the cost and nobody gets hurt or unemployed   errrr  only the pest gets hurt I meant,positive
Who can I contact about getting these in my area,negative
How long will it be until TERRORISTS learn to deliver chemical weapons this wayAt the very least Im not a fan of chemicals on plants for consumption,negative

Man DJI you are killin the game keep it up Thats the only way you will always be 1,negative
This drone is the reason the spraying workers lost there jobs lol,negative
normal que apres en a plus de travaille de  la merde votre invention,positive
DJ I why do you guys take at least 85 days to resolve issues with failed drones,negative
Such a fantastic use of technology I wonder how much spray the drone can carry each trip,positive
Started with toys now we are there Very good work,positive
so now they want to take jobs from these poor farmers also,negative
My favorite brand for drones A perfect job,positive
Gee I wonder why theyre using gloves to touch it lol,negative
I only eat organic filthy peasants,negative
Finally a drone to water my roses,positive

Jus how technology makes everything easier and more efficient,positive
Can I fill it with beer,negative
Wow Im not even a farmer and I thought this was so cool I love how you guys are expanding to make drones useful for all situations I hope to have a drone some day,positive
Well done DJI you guys are pioneers of the future,positive
son unos cracks sigan as like,negative
Sure a worker would take a whole day and sure now it takes the drone two minutes to perform the task but youre not including the out of band maintenance setup etc in that two minute per spray estimate  Yes your product is probably much more efficient but youre not accounting for the actual amount of time a person would spend using it to perform the task only the time carried out  Thats like not including maintenance bills for your automobile when factoring in how much it costs to operate a vehicle,negative
ur using my idea I will give  petision to police or give me a phantom 4,negative
I wonder how flight time this has and the amount of weight this can carry,negative
Makes sense and pretty neat,positive
DJI  You are amazing im in South Africa and im just thinking of how many farmers would benefit from such Techi cant wait to buy my own DJI droneLoyal Fan,positive
Do you guys have a drone that can take me to work Shit just add some straps to this and a compartment for my items and its a go Why keep driving this bulky car and wasting time in traffic,negative
I love drones and all but this is just stupid Why do it with a drone when you can do it faster cheaper and more efficiently with a tractor,negative
I love because stable fly,positive
Im coming to believe that dji is gonna solve all of the worlds problems and save us all,positive
lol they invented it I made this drone almost 2 years ago,negative
these guys  DJI  never sleep,positive
Graffitti Bot here We ComE,neutral
I admire their work But this is bullshit You need to charge it You need to get it out there You need to prepare it You need to maintain it You need to refill it All that will cost more time and money than thought Drones use alot of energy to stay afloat And the energy density for drones isnt there yet for heavy payloads such as carrying water The smaller they are the less efficient If that drone was 4 time the size then yeah its cost effective but we are not there yet Nice advertisement though,negative
After watching this I cant wait to get the first drone for my Tech channel,negative
were living in the future now,positive
If u dont have a drone  u cant call yourself a farmerXD,negative
and dji still cant use stronger plastic to prevent stress cracks in the phantom series,negative

Pretty cool  whats the price,positive
No one do like that,negative
spray the world dji   so what chemicals are the spraying dji,negative
Hopefully I can swoop one of these at Best Buy soon,negative
What is spraying out of the drone,negative
So 12 people 8 hours to cover 80 acres 60 hourly pay since technician needs training  I would guess about 1000 for labor maybe slightly more Estimate total cost would be 1500 to 2000 to cover 80 acres in one day,negative
I love this company You guys are relentless in pushing the bar for consumer innovation through the roof Great work,positive
Finally a drone that pees,negative
i want this m just gonna sell my iPhoneCarand home and may be half of my Farm land,negative
This would be great for Pepper spray for those losers who riot like babies,negative
Productivity  Employment Opportunity for poor,positive
I cant quite work out if this is even a viable option How many times it would take to refill and swap batteries over say an acre Would be for fairly limited applications,negative
Change the pesticide  fertilizer into Arsenic poison,negative
Set the path into enemy military base  dense urban population,negative
Thats a really good idea,positive
Cool but doesnt that mean you need to refill the drone every 10 minutes and then also replace its battery,negative
Also 20 drones Thats like 25000 dollars surely Chinese human labor is cheaper,negative
Wow I didnt even know you guys did stuff like this This is awesome,positive
top de mais  dji nmero 1 em inovaes,negative
Its especially great that it flys low and doesnt waste Spray  also great to follow the Altitude,positive
How many YEARS Wages does it cost the people in the Video,negative

that plow works pretty good for small pipe in loose soil doesnt do up to 24 I doubt if it does 6 it would be completely useless in situations where you arent draining your laterals into a ditch if you had to tie into a mainline youd have to dig a 10 foot wide start get a Wolfe Super Plow 600 you can switch out your boot to install tile up to 24 in about any type of soil,negative

Sometimes I eat a Bit of quinoa washed 10 times I make it with coconut milk and grandmas spices But Im only allowed 2040 carbs per day Id love to eat barley and buckwheat I could eat a tiny bit but then I couldnt eat some of the wonderful green vegetables Id rather eat winged beans and bitter melon salad Some of grandmas dishes I eat with a side of chopped cucumber instead of quinoa When I count carbs using the app Lose It I find an amazing amount of carbs in green beans and other green vegetables,positive

The answer is Honey Crisp Anyhow you didnt state whether the bag goes in the fridge for that germination period or not Some recommend it but some dont so Id like clarification please,negative
You MUST   let the people know that if you grow from seed the apple tree WILL NOT produce the variety of apple the seed is from this is done ONLY by grafting  The tree that grows will be one of a million types of apples which will 9999 percent be an uneatable apple    What the real Johnny Apple Seed did was teach people how to graft apple trees  This is why there are so very few varieties of apples The macintosh being the oldest since this was the first eatable apple they came across by chance and renewed it for decades and centuries   Without grafting the seed produces a random new genetic variety  There will be people who plant seed and wait years to finally get apples from there germinated seed with great disappointment and wasted years,negative
This could have been done in 2 minutes,negative
It is either Empire or Honey Crisp,positive
Why still have people doing this stupid thing,negative

You all do know that you cant grow the specific type of apple from the seed of that apple dont you The apple tree is grafted with the specific type of apple that the grower wants to grow The tree that the apple is grafted onto is chosen because of its hardiness and resistance to disease The seeds from a Pink Lady will not grow a Pink Lady apple,negative

Unfortunately most apples are from grafted stock that means that a branch from the tree of the eating apple you want is transplanted onto a different apple tree which would have been selected for its strengths So the seeds from the apple in the video will probably not grow the same apples Some gardeners have hundreds of different varieties on one tree,negative

Will you get apples this way  I always heard you need to graft an apple tree in order to get fruit edible fruit,positive
The Apple is a SWEETANGO,positive
I think these videos and this isnt the only one are a real disservice to you tube users  To  talk about growing apples from seeds without telling anyone that the chances of ever getting an apple from a tree grown from seed is about 35000 to 1  The video and even the description make it sound like if you plant a tree from a seed that comes from your favorite apple then you will be growing that apple and will someday get to pick your own from your seed grown tree  I feel so sorry for the average person who may go to all the trouble of buying their favorite apple getting a seed from that apple to sprout using  your method or any other and then find a place in their yard where they plant and care for their tree with pride for the next 35 years only to find out it only produces little crabapple sized knotty green fruit or disease prone apples that taste awful or produce nothing at all  How hard would it be to add a single sentence in the description saying NOTE  If you arent going to graft a known variety onto your seedgrown seed its extremely unlikely you will ever get fruit  Look it up people this is a waste of time and effort,negative
they stole it from MSU,negative

Apples grown from seed do NOT produce a true to the parent tree apple variety The only way to produce a true variety is from a cutting off of the parent tree Yes the seed will be an apple tree but it will  be a genetically substandard and most likely produce inedible fruit This I learned in High School so apparently you either failed that course or never took the course in the first place,negative
I have a few seedling growing right   now they are around 3 or 4 inches tall They are inside of a terrarium type pot inside my house and have been doing fine in full sun since i planted them after germination It got super cold outside and they were next to a window of course and my house got down to about 60 degrees Now some of the leaves are turning black and dying That is happening on my apple and peach seedlings Please help,positive

i got itits an APPLE,positive
Apple trees should not be grown from seeds because the apple tree does not produce an efficient root Rather a branch of an apple tree is grafted onto a rootstock which is usually derived from a rowan The rowan Sorbus aucuparia is a tree related to apple trees Malus pumila but it has a much more efficient root This gives us more apples and fruit production will start early in a couple of years as opposed to a decade or two later Also apple seeds will not result in a tree that produce the same variety of apples To get a consistent fruit the apple tree must be cloned Grafting a branch onto a rowan rootstock ensures this cloning and also a root large and efficient enough to sustain good fruit production In commercial fruit production a commercial rootstock is used but for an apple tree in the garden a wild rowan will be good enough,positive
hello there can i plant it in cameroon,positive

Hard to identify wo actually tasting it However it looks like a Gala Pink Lady Fuji or Honeycrisp These all look the same  are similar to the size of baseball smaller than a softball  All of those are quite sweet not at all tangy such as a Granny Smith,negative
HOWEVER based on the small size  you said it was a little tart Id say its a Jonathon Theyre small bigger than golf ball smaller than a baseball  have a sweet tart flavor  a dense texture slightly gritty Macintosh for example are softer  not gritty  red or golden delicious are medium soft red is gritty goldens are not,positive
Ill admit thst Ive never seen Jonathon apples in any retail or produce stores Only at apple orchards farms  a tree that was on the property I grew up on Ohio,negative
At one time there were approximately 60 trees about a dozen varieties  several other fruit trees WONDERFUL place to grow up,positive
All seeds have an oilwax in the shell that breaks down and allows the plant to emerge the trick to germination is to recreate the conditions that best suit the seed to be grown,positive
I use the airing cupboard floor to provide suitable temperature and remove at the first sign of growth usually within two to three days some seeds require UV light so check first,negative
Warmth and water  some soil or nutrient to use when the store of goodies in the seed run out Good seedling compost or soil has enzymes that help germination there are no green fingers in nature just good or bad conditions,negative
Is it a granny Smith,positive
Is it a swee tango,negative
Im sorry to those who though the apple was a pink lady  It looks very much like it however it isnt since they were first produced in Western Australia in 1973  I believe that the apple may be a SweeTango brand name or Minneiska is a cultivated variety of apple Malus domestica developed by the University of Minnesota in 2000 and first sold in the US in 2009,positive

My sis brought some apples home once from a wild tree shed spotted that was growing  beside a ditch near a district works yard They were pretty yellow with sort of red stripes and the absolute best apples Ive ever tasted before or since There were various farms in the area so maybe birds had excreted an apple seed that grew or someone had thrown an apple core at the ditch who knows,negative
Anyway we talked about going back and getting cuttings from the tree but of course life had other plans we moved away,negative
Ive been back in the area a few times but I cant find the tree The land beside the ditches looks like it was cleared to the ground by the district so sadly I think it is RIP tree I still remember those apples though,negative

You suck at explaining how to germinate apple seed for one the camera was not centered correctly and it felt like something was missing Then you did not explain or elaborate on the solution how much to use And worst at the end you negated using the method you just showed by saying you might as well just plant seed on good soil and should germinate You better have other good videos or Im unsubscribing,negative

ChickenYale is exactly right  Why do you put out this type of thing  The variety is SweeTango but they grow it using a Minneiska root stock looked up that part on the internet  Other apple tree root stocks would also work  BUT ALL apples we buy that are any good at all are grown by grafting the variety like SweeTango onto a hardy root stock another apple tree that is trimmed down and the variety you want SweeApple Red Delicious or whatever is grafted onto that tree  So again why do you mislead people  Do yo not know the difference  And THAT is why the Johnny Appleseed story is mostly myth unless the trees he planted from seed were just used a root stock and the pioneers brought THEIR OWN apple tree cuttings to graft on,negative
So as an example ALL THE BILLIONS of Re Delicious Apples were in effect grown from ONE TREE   Cuttings were taken from tree after tree after tree after treeand were grafted onto a different root stock,negative
honeycrisp lemme know amiright or sweeTango it looks like honeycrisp but sweeTango was a mixture of a honeycrisp im pretty sure so im gonna guess that its either honeycrisp or sweeTango,negative

When I was 8 Im 12 now I was eating a apple and I noticed a seed fell on the floor and I picked it up and asked my mom if I can plant it and she said yes so she got me a lil pot for the beginning and she got me a lil shovel and gloves and after awhile it started to grow in the pot so we took it out and put it in our yard and now its growing good and I asked if I can have more plants and she said yes my mom is so nice and I now grow fruit vegetables flowers and berries and there turning out real good,positive

fruit trees are grafted to get a specific variety rose bushes are grafted  on to wild rose roots because they are not hardy in the midwestnorth if you plant a seed you will  NOT get what you bought at the store if you get fruit I can provide what apple trees are required to pollinate other apple trees if requested Really though save a headache just buy an apple tree at the nursery NEVER buy plants online and shoo away these organic morons who dont understand that  organic is a SCAM,negative

What do you do with the apple sprouts Use them for rootstock,negative
If you want apples just like the ones you have acquired the seeds from you must graft a stem from that apple tree onto new root stock  If you just take the seeds directly from the apple and plant them you may produce apples that are not consistent to that type of apple  All of the seeds will be diverse and not uniform in their product  All varieties of apples to remain true to their variety have to be grafted onto rootstock I do like your hydrogen peroxide technique,negative

We have only six apple trees but they produce magic apples  I tell people that if you eat one of ours you will ever be able to eat storebought again  They laugh that is until they take the first bite  I swear to heaven it is true  We inherited these trees when we bought the house 8 years ago and probably several hundred people have been ruined for all time,positive

Might be honey crisp or maybe crispin though they tend to be more greenish Soing apple seed is the only way to discover new varieties through the tastiest apples you select Graphing can be more predictable about the pollinator I guess I thought it was going to grow out the apple too  be about the embryo benefitting the seed vs fruit attracting seed spreadinggrowing I just had to know why the apple in the photo wasnt brown yet My favorite is Cameo,negative
Try a Fuji Apple its the best,positive
its a pink lady apple,positive

Pink Lady or honey crisp  Thanks for you video,positive
If you want to grow from seed just leave an apple in the crisper for three months when you cut the apple the seeds are already sprouting In about 48 yrs you may see fruit  Go  buy a dwarf tree It may take 810 yrs for a full sized apple tree to produce 4 yrs for a dwarf Dwarf usually grow 20ft high full size grow 60 ft high 30 ft wide and have trunks you can hug  The down fall of full sized is spraying for disease or bugs youll need a gas powered heavy duty pressure washer Also one tree can make thousands of apples so you best have time to process even dwarf trees you get more to feed a race track full of horses till they are drunk,negative

I would like to add one important word to the comments already made  Apples and potatoes are heterozygous  Growing from seed is not reliable As has been said before its a roll of the dice or a box of chocolates All the mackintosh apples grew from tiny little pieces of wood with a bud from one single tree in eastern Canada Apple seeds are used to find new varieties NOT to reproduce the apple that carried them,negative

Growing edible fruit trees and other plants using all these artificial products is horrible Can as well just buy cans,negative
Just so that you are aware the seeds inside of any apple youl buy in a store wont genetically match the profile of the parent plant In other words the tree that you will grow from that seed wont have the same flavor as the apple you took the seed from If you already knew this or you are just growing a tree for fun then no problem,positive
If you are interested in growing that cultivar of apple the easiest way to do so would be to graft the parent tree on to a root stock  even the one you are growing from that seed is fine However generally in apple breeding and cultivation certain root stocks are selected for disease resistance and vigor,negative
Growing apple trees by seed is always a gamble that can take between 515 years before you get any fruit or thats what a friend and professor who is an apple breeder told me when I was in college In any case its fun so enjoy and if the apple tree you grow isnt what you were expecting you can even go ahead and graft a new one on later though it might be a little more challenging I have two apple trees growing here one of them has five varieties of apples that grow from it and the other is just one Im sure youll enjoy your own once it comes up,positive
Yep so much easier just sticking seeds in the dirt,negative

Its easy to plant a seed  get a small tree but it will NOT grow fruit true to whatever apple you got your seeds from so dont have  expectations of starting your own backyard orchard  You need cuttings from the original tree to get the same fruit and unfortunately all new varieties are protected by patents The older patents may have expired by now but you still need a cutting not a seed,negative

In the wild apples grow readily from seeds However like most perennial fruits apples are ordinarily propagated asexually by grafting This is because seedling apples are an example of extreme heterozygotes in that rather than inheriting DNA from their parents to create a new apple with those characteristics they are instead significantly different from their parents Wikipedia,negative

Im sure someone has probably stated it already but any apple tree you grow from a seed is a crap shoot since there too much genetic diversity in apple stocks  The only way to get a specific kind of apple is to graft on branches of that kind of tree onto a stock trunk which is what you are going to get from planing a seed,negative
Anyway thats my two cents good video though,negative
My fianc thinks its a Pink Cripps,negative
While it is true that apple hybrids dont grow true from seed it really doesnt matter most of the time They will probably still be fine for apple crumble and pies,negative
I thought some seeds now would only grow trees without fruit gmos maybe Not so,negative
the devil disliked the video,negative
Can you do this same method with grape seeds,negative
if Trump sends Mexicans back no more exotics putos,negative
love the music and your videos Thank you for sharing,positive
you will get a standard sized tree the root controls the size of the tree privet root stock will give you a dwarf tree bud the kind of apple that you want on the root cut the root tree off just above the new bud,negative
Was that a gala Apple,positive

Bra Burn or Honey Crisp Now I will have to try apple seeds,negative
I think its a Braeburn,negative
Its the Jesus apple Not everyone likes it because it took a lot of manure to grow the original tree Apparently 12 gardeners worked until they died to establish the first one Heaps of dung were required to feed it and it never really fulfilled its potential and the time spent on its fruitless nurturing drove nations apart Its a hard sell apple but unknown numbers of starving people were force fed on it once the trees were producing Why were they starving Because the crops they grew for millennia were not deemed suitable by the Jesus apple growers who crossed the seas and planted their seeds The Jesus apple tree grows ferociously in primitive lands It overcomes all indigenous and endemic life It   Also billions of humans around the world cant stand the taste of it Its bitter and makes people angry when they taste it But there are those that savour its essence   for them its so sweet in their mouths that they sing together about its flavour and create communities around its appeal no pun intended They are all smiles within their various Jesus apple loving communities but if someone tells them that the Jesus apple tastes like shit really it does then said communities cant accept  that fact Actually there are so many communities growing seeds from the original fruit from the first Jesus apple tree that they war amongst themselves One community clans from now on to save typing strokes has some weird ideas about how to serve the Jesus apple They insist that the red of the apple is blood and the pasty white inside is flesh WTF Cannibal apple eaters Now how to serve the Jesus apple to noncannibals Wow can someone help me out here There are probably 1000 variants out there regarding The Serving Of The Apple,negative
Which one of these myriad recipes does the lover of the Jesus apple choose The bitter one The one that states this is all you need to eat to be healthy and fulfilled Or the recipe that says If you dont eat this apple you will be destined to an eternity Yes eternity Thats forever and everan eternity of pain suffering freakedoutedness confusion delusion,negative
I choose anything but the Jesus apple The apple I grow is a thing of beauty available to all people There is no caveat to tasting it feeling it marvelling at its complexity and at its simplicity There is nothing you cant do with this apple Taste a piece  if its bitter then youre chewing it wrong Move it in your mouth  Now its sweet next its sour now its unami Use your senses and dont rely on one bitter apple to decide your lifes path Just a thought,positive
Its called a Jazz Apple,positive

You should consider equalizing your audio I dont think many of your viewers appreciate your intro and end card being 300 louder than you talking Whatever youre using as a video editor should support adjusting volume Maybe youve already solved this in newer vids,negative
Fuji apple ot honeycrisp But looks more like a Fuji,negative
Poor deluded fool doesnt give any warnings to those who might think that it matters what apple the seed came from  Apple never produces true to seed   thats a search engine phrase you should use it and learn vastly more than this guy knows  Apple breeding relies on pure luck and 100 wrong trees grown to the one that is in fact quite good  15 to 20 years of time investment  The good one is then grafted onto suitable rootstock and a breed is born  No other way is it done  They are not done by germinating a single seed as shown here end of story  You really want a good apple tree you buy one with ten years of growth already done and you dont have to wait 15 to find out you planted a turkey and the past 15 years has been a wash  Now if you got room for 100 you can sure try it of course but hundreds of years have shown that apple never produces true to seed  This is changing just for you of course,negative
Cyanide is made from apple seeds,negative

Enjoyed your video very informative  I would add that the soil method works but never got them to grow in the time frame you quoted  I have gotten them to grow that way but only if I put them in the refrigerator for up too 45 days,positive
so put seed in soil put some water on soil  seed grows into tree  who would have thought,negative
that looked like a Nikita,negative
If it is so uncertain the quality of fruit this method might produce then how about just growing some trees this way to provide root stock for future grafts from the trees in your garden that are already producing name brand fruit,negative
you should try tango apples or ambrosia,negative

Unless you are grafting from an already established variety of apple you will never get the exact same variety when planting a seed If you are going for what my grandfather called spitters small tart crabapple type of apple then by all means plant as many seeds as you would like Spitters are useful if you plan on making lots of apple cider vinegar or to cross pollinate with eating or pie variety apples to change or modify the acidity of the sweeter varieties,negative
Bottom line  if you want a variety that you like go to a nursery and buy a few 23 yr old grafted trees,negative

Shouldnt you be grafting if you want a good apple tree  From my understanding planting from seed is a roll of the dice since there is no guarantee it will be the same apple or quality  Why waste the effort on a gamble,negative

Fuji or Honeycrisp  When will you tell us,negative
You never get a video that includes the thumbnail,negative
Would you not have to wait a huge amount of time for the tree to bear fruit In the UK most apple trees are grafted onto a semi dwarfing rootstock a cutting or scion is then grafted onto the rootstock the rootstock chosen is less vigorous and keeps the trees to a more manageable size This also means you get fruit a lot quicker than just sowing seeds as you have done You can do it your way but you will need to buy a ladder and be more patient like waiting about 20 years for the tree to bear fruit,neutral

I grew apple trees in large pots inside my house for two years putting them outside during warm weather  I live in Tennessee   Everyday I fed them leftover cool coffee  coffee grounds  They are huge now  My husband and I planted them outside just last Summer and they are still looking good  I think it will be another year or so before they actually have fruit but I am excited about them   Actually all I did when I planted them was I used the regular seedling soil and I did not cut them as you did and they grew up nicely,positive
looks like what we get in Trinidad called Gala  is that the answer,negative

Sandpaper taped inside of a matchbox helps penetrate your seeds inner layer after youve done this leave the seeds to germinate for in 24 hours in room temperature tap watercontains organic mattercold water shocks roots Then take the seeds and put them inside small folded paper towel cuttings put them into a open containerbox store the box in a dark clean spacecloset or dresserfor about a week and spray them everyday with tap water and always make sure to keep them moistBecause the seeds roots will dry up and become damaged if you forget seedsseedling during growth do not need fertilizer tap water contains enough nutrients for them Apply this method to any seed and you will have a 100 germination rate with no risk of damaging your seeds Your way is not wrong your method works great its just not for everyone If you want to make liquid fertilizer use raw meat tie it in a clothclean rag and let it soak in a bucket like a tea bag for about a weekplants feed on bacteria to grow so any kind of bacteria producing substance could be used this way,negative
Results from this method is iffy youll get fruit but may or may not be the same Better methods are grafting on to root stick or some ppl are rooting branches right on the tree,negative

Just read The Botany of Desire by Michael Pollan He gives an excellent history of Apples and where all the various types of Apples came from According to Pollen Love the double entente mrpush is right in saying you never know what kind of apple you will get Apple seeds do not grow a tree like the one the seeds came from Every seed produces a new and distinct tree Usually something like a crab apple All the apple trees we grow are grafts from one original version of that tree For example there was ever only ONE Red Delicious tree discovered growing among many other cider type trees in an orchard Every other Red Delicious is a graft from that tree or more likely from trees grafted with branches from a graft from that first and only RD tree,positive

Big thanks to Japan Also you are kindly requested to engage with the Iraqi Government to provide generous contribution to rehabilitate under your supervision the Baiji fertilizers factory and restore its design capacity This project would support the agriculture sector mainly in the areas that have recently been liberated and retaken from Daesh terrorists As you may know Ninawa was the bread basket of Iraq through production of wheat and barely as well as other crops which have severely been damaged by the terror acts Thanks again,positive
Thank you Japanese people and Japanese Government,positive
We are so happy to see the kind of excellent job that the Japanese corporations are doing in Iraq especially in the fertilizer plant in Basra There is a similar plant built by the same company in Beiji that suffered from destruction and looting by ISIL militants on behalf of the Iraqi people generally and Salah Al Deen Province people particularly we kindly request that the government of Japan may consider rehabilitating this plant knowing that this plant used to feed thousands of families by hiring their sons to work in it Those employees are without jobs now We are so happy to see the rule of the empire of Japan in Iraq and we will be more happy to see The Japan touch in Salah Al Deen province,positive

Yes and good luck finding enough land to graze them all on Americans would have to drastically reduce their meat and dairy consumption in order to support this model Grass fed meat raised in small farms is at this point only for people with money or more money than what the majority of fast food is feeding which is low income families in food deserts Encouraging a vegan diet is good in that it will hopfefully get folks to reduce overall meat and dairy consumption Which if done properly is just as healthy as a properly done omnivore diet Also calcium is available in plants b12 is easily supplemented if needed,positive
I live in Canada and what you see on most farms is corn and soybeans Not for human consumption  but to fatten up pigs and cows I guess   grass fed animals that are given a decent life and killed for the survival of your family I can live with Theres nothing as far as vitamins thats lacking in a vegan diet only b12 thats found in the soil that animals eat When we used to drink from streams b12 was plentiful now that weve progressed its an easy fix to take a supplement,negative
the land area alone needed to grass feed the amount of meat people eat is not feasible Better off encouraging a mostly plant based diet with a little meat and or dairy if wanted but very sparingly,negative
Dave Asprey 73 of the beef market is used burgers or mince  start ups like Gates funded  Impossible Foods can produce better tasting plant based burgers using  GMO yeast ferment taste components that replicate the beef taste perfectly  We all know the burger chains will feed us anything  especially at half the cost  There are 20 of these start ups with 3 billion combined funding  With a loss of the burger mince mince market steak prices will skyrocket and we can revert the land to its proper purpose,negative
Thats the good thing about freedom of choice we dont ALL have to be Vegans only those who choose to be These hypothetical situations will not happen in our lifetimes as long as we can still choose what to eat,positive
Do you have a breakdown of the nutritional content vs a real meat burger,negative
Here is another one  The nutritional issues im can be a engineered to nearly anything the example though is yet another silicon alley start up distracting a massive traditional market through innovative be use of technology,negative

Pamela Jeanne Harmon Soylent is anothe Bill Gates start up,positive
Steve George I know but the point is not whether its good for you its whether it will happen anyway whatever we think   I wouldnt touch it past my initial sample but the burger chains wont care whether it has good omega levels or inflammatory ingredients,negative
The argument presupposes that because we stopped slaughtering animals for food they somehow wouldnt be around to collect manure from,negative
I seriously hope no one is truly entertaining eating engineered fake meat I once have had to seriously talk a patient out of continuing to eat Quorn  probably another brainchild of some  entrepreneur who wanted to save the world Please,negative
Roman Krupa I think its highly probable that it will happen and happen at scale  Remember its a very small community that has any idea about nutrition so the barriers for it happening are extremely low,negative

We dont give shelter to homeless people Why would we do it for free to animals,negative
If only there was some other way other than using livestock to turn plant matter into fertilizer,negative
I tried for a while but my genetics arent cut for longevity though a vegan diet My relatives and ancestors stayed young and fit by eating primarily meat obtained though hunting a necessary practice here and fatty fish and local Alaskan plants I cannot consume sugar grains starches additives or soy or most nuts so it narrows down my options quickly,negative
Though I do support my vegan counterparts and the ethics of what they are trying to accomplish They bring balance which in my opinion is very important,positive

Melanie Moore I believe in eating real whole unprocessed foods That fake meat is not real food 100 grass fed beef is real food Good for our body Good for our environment Very simple to me,positive
Im not in the cult of vegan But I use animal poop myself Rabbit from our bunnies horse poop from the local police horse barn and occasionally cow poop Nearby sanctuaries also let people have poop,negative
I did not forget that animals kill each other No one forgot that animals kill each other EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET knows about the food chain,positive
this is why im vegan free asprey,negative
Thats my question Dave answer this,positive
EXACTLY the question i was going to propose but made sure to see if someone else asked first it is absurd to think animals would disappear if we stopped using them for food literally that makes no sense,negative
Emily Lawless there are a lot of people in complete denial to how cruel Mother Nature can be,negative
They forget that animals kill each other Give me a break And the vast majority of food animals are bred to be food animals Where would we put them all Well we wouldnt breed them so there goes that problem Hunting wild animals that overpopulate without any predators Fine As for the rest so much for people reasoning it out anymore,negative
Wow leave it to a food debate to bring out the dumbs  Christie what planet do you live on Because I live on one where we do give shelter to homeless people and to animals for free Hell I let animals sleep in my bed and cater to their every sadfaced plea And still sheltering animals is not relevant to the comment Are you aware that wild animals survive without the help of shelter from humans,negative
Vegans often conveniently forget about the entire ecosystems that are destroyed in order to clear land to plant all these grains that sustain their diet,negative
You can pry the steak from my cold dead hands,negative
So plants are ok to killnever did understand this ethics argument life is life Respect all life Lots of plant life has a higher and more compleated DNA then Humans It is all about easing  the guilt being a vegan will do nothing to save the earth,positive
Most  farm animals are not evolved to go wild,negative

Grass fed is great until winter hits,positive
This guy gets disqualified for having an actual informed discussion on this from the outset with this sentence Apart from the fact that a plantbased diet lacks key nutrients to keep you running at full power That tells me he knows NOTHING about vegan dietsI have friends that have raised their kids vegan and they have never had illness due to their diets See the link below on vegan NBA athletes Wow how can they perform as top level professionals in their sport on a vegan diet  Moron As for the no fertilizer argument thats like saying what will we do with the animals if we dont eat them  They were all once wild  I dont know much about fertilizer and havent studied the issue so I cant give an informed opinion But the idea that our species cannot survive without domesticated animals raised for meat has no factual basis I would also look further into this persons background Nine times out of ten they have ties to the meat and dairy industries in one way or another  I dont know this guy but if you find any ties at all to these industries be very suspect of his opinion,negative

Alhamdu Lillah Mashaallah  This is news That of my state Niger in Minna that was abandon for years is now one of the busiest areas with lot of actives Apart from providing jobs through fertilizer production one can also see food vendors and other petty business activities going on The area is so lively God bless,positive
Yes sir This is the kind of change we want to be experiencing in line with your party slogan,positive
It will get better Rome was not built in a day,negative
Thank God for this CHANGE especially in kaduna State we could have been in hand of 3rd class holder  who spent 250 million Naira for the title that he is not descendant to it,positive

You still need to do moremore as for the five thousand five hundred per bag which we are not getting During last administration we used to get two bags of fertilizer and three kilograms of seeds of your choice,negative
Do you sit in your 6ft by 6ft room to know if 50 000 jobs have been created,negative
Stop this propaganda my friend  Where are d jobs,negative
Dont assume that you are better than d people you meet on social media I can see  you are just an empty barrel,negative
This is the fund that the apc condemned when it came on stream in the day of GEJ but today you are hailing it and taking credits in as much as it is good that some fertilizer blending firms are up and runningcredits should be given to the initiators of the fund,positive
Write a comment We thank to allah,positive
Marx Ohtugo and Eddy Sanchez this is for your information  Over N50 billion saved and over 50000 jobs created,negative

Why not go to the blending plants and see for yasef,negative
But quick to call people names indicate lack of ideas,negative
No body called anybody names hereI only responded to his insult What ideas do you have Please tell me I want to learn from you,negative
It was almost impossible getting fertilizer at the socalled government regulated prize in Kaduna I had to buy from another State more than 5 hrs away from Kaduna So I wonder if other genuine farmers were able to buyso for me this prize reduction story is a hoax,negative
I see youre committed to the education of young people  Teenage graduate tells ElRufai,positive
Another one is being provided soon when new bags are printed Just stay tuned,negative
Go to Golden Fertilizer Depot at Kudenda you will get it at N5500,negative
Its is available in every local government head quarters in Kaduna now as I am speaking at N5500,neutral
Thank you Falade for your kind reaponse Sir I wish it was made available before now Cos who really needs it now Considering that most farmers that need fertilizer either cultivate maize or rice NPK application is mostly over and a lot have already applied Urea I think timing is an area of improving if the government truly wants to make an impact God bless Nigeria and Kaduna State,negative

Luke Jepson we have stricter noise limits from 11pm as most festivals do however it is the way in which we will be managing the on site noise that has changed dramatically this year Last year on the Saturday night we were put under a lot of pressure and were not as prepared as needed but a big lesson learnt for this year and a huge amount of time and focus from highly qualified industry professionals will be going in to avoiding negative impact on the crowd experience while maintaining limits off site for the local residents We will be aiming to release more information on this as it is important everyone is clear change has been made So in brief we do have noise limits but we believe that they will be fairly un noticeable due to hugely improved noise management plan and execution Feel free to contact directly if you want to discuss in more detail,negative

Hi  its the right balance   i can tell you  initially i went the hardship as well What i learnt is  preparing the soil conditions  light  and selecting the best seed plant solved majority of the problem related to pests There are so many traditional approaches When i mentioned  Organic fertiliser it was just cow manure or compost which can be made at home easily  using vegetables peels and fruit peels,positive
Pesticides is always neem oil or the 3G solution made from your ginger garlic green chillies,negative

Hi could not find ur reply,negative
Mohan great to see your garden and experiences developing a rich fully organic fruit and vegetable patch in a small area When I used to live in bangalore I thought it would be a good idea for someone to take over small gardens of apartments and plant fruits and vegetable plants for a monthly service fee instead of fancy lawns Would be great if you could hire some local gardeners and offer such a service to small plot owners and apartments,positive
Hi  first lets understand mealy bugs mealy bugs are sticky white coloured creatures  easy to identify,negative
But always a hint lies with Ants yes  Ants feed on the honeydew when you find ants crawling around your plants indoors or out or observed making a nice trail from a plant,positive
Take some time to examine your houseplants closely for these sucking pests,negative
In most cases natural predators provide enough control for mealybugs keeping the population at levels too low to cause lasting damage to your plants But mealybug populations may surge if enough natural predators dont visit your yard,negative
Parasitic wasps are the main mealybug predators There are many types of parasitic wasps all of which you can attract with the right plants like marigold  rosemary etc,positive
If the mealy bugs are more  jet spray with water as much as possible  you can also  buy neem oil dilute it with water and spray on the mealy bug affected part  first spray on a small area and then check if it affects the plant   if the infestation is really high  you can cut that part and dispose it far  before it spreads to other plants,negative
Use neem oil  in moderation esp It has to be diluted  and you will slowly see the results,negative
Forgot to add  Control the Ants  as they are the ones that protect mealy bugs,negative
If you could kindly share ur learningslinksbook info if any that we can study too do let us know,negative
Fascinating to see what grows in such a different climate from mine Its all beautiful,positive

Spraying ash on sapling helps  Then I used compost and well dried manure to reduce insects,negative

organic food becomes expensive for 3 reasons 1 lack of mass market 2 prone to more wastage compared to chemical farming 3 involves lot of trialanderror as there is no Package of PracticePoP for  organic farming,negative
I think demand is actually high for organic food Unless cultivated on a large scale that cannot be met and mass marketed and wastage I did not get that Crop waste can go as fodder or dried up and used as dry flower bouquets and potpourri stuff For the third one fortunately many ppl are awakening in realising the essence of natural food and air,positive
I too hope will start giving back to nature,positive
If you want the best grow the best,positive

Too bad the big guys are squeezing the life out of the farmers to make a buck while the senior management make all the profits and fat bonuses Theyve been there a few years make the money and runThey then use tax payers money for farmers and their families to provide support and counselling services as they send them to the wall And they cry farmers need to be innovative Aussies farmers getting screwed again Think they could trim some of their fat wages and have better and more ethical management farmers could just get on with the job being legends What a timely parody for these guys trying to look good,negative

As farmers we manage our land our livestockcropsmachinery and our people work assets we manage our daily accounting our forecasts and our cash flow We are the customers of the banks  In general  our skillsets are greater than those who lend us money to conduct our businesses  lets be proud of this  Lets make the consumers aware and proud of what we do and acknowledge our skill sets   we have allowed a disconnect between us and them and they frequently comment that we choose to do what we do and then whinge when things go wrong Lets mend this disconnect  we may thing they are demanding etc and on the wrong track but they do buy our produce Lets keep our capmpaigns truthful and positive Our customers can also often be other big businesses WooliesColes etc who are out to keep their shareholders happy like the banks  they want a profit  but so do we  we can only win by working together  and this also means leaving our disgruntlement with farm bodies eg NFF at the farm gate The world is a cut throat place so lets work together and be seen with those who are trying to improve our lot and there are many  lets give out a positive united vibe  we are the best  lets help each other stay the best  and yes well fall in a heap now and then  but lets work at picking ourselves up before we fall if we can  Lets be aware and active in whats going on out there  keep the complacent dog at bay,positive

This is the best commercial ever I imagine this is exactly how it would go if you asked a bunch of suits to run a farm The average consumer has no idea the work involved in a day in our  shoes Well done,positive
Until you have spent actual time farming and raising livestock you have no more right to accuse farmers in general of cruelty than we do of you for having a cat or dog I will agree there are a few bad apples amongst farmers and pet owners Please do not assume because you saw one news article about a lazy farmer not tending his animals that we are all the same nor will I believe that because I saw a news article about dog fighting that my neighbor is secretly running a chihuahua fight club in his basement,negative
Jackie Fuller I believe the difference is a dairy is twice a day every day EVERY DAY  365 weekends birthdays Easter Christmas No vacation no sick days And when they arent milking they are feeding birthing scraping poop I know everyone works hard in every job done its just that as you stroll thru the grocery store buying what you need please remember a lot of very hard working farmers choose to spend every day working beside their families in a barn to provide America those groceries and its a very thankless job,positive

Why UK isnt on the map in green,negative
It isnt just Monsanto Its almost every Democrat and Republican in power How else could police go after young mothers protecting their kids from vaccines or chemotherapy Yet Monsanto goes around terrorizing other farmer trespassing into their property and creating a monopoly in the food industry Congress could have taken action long ago and instead they stay quiet because they really support Monsanto and think the alternative doctors and young mothers are misguided people who need the government to tell you everything to do,negative
They shouldnt be grown at all,negative
Even if they just take the subsidies away from GMO corn I think they would go out of business,negative
Drug companies make huge profits from all of this Also now that so many people have realized that Big Pharma is great in emergencies but for health care its terrible they pass the affordable care act to force everybody to buy from big Pharma Even if you decide not to get insurance you will still pay a fee to pay for other peoples insurance which only covers stuff like drugs and surgery,negative
Its not complety truein FRance for instance glyphosate is still allowed for the next 3 or 4 years,negative

Glysophate causes cancer thats why theres class action lawsuits for farm workers happening now Glysophate ruins the soil and ground water thats not sustainable Glysophate causes weeds and pests to adapt becoming resistant to the amounts of the poison used in turn more of said poison must be used to combat the resistance Not sustainable Also your thought process is flawed and uninformed at best also not sustainable Cheers,negative
Organic produce has become increasingly popular in recent years as consumers have grown more health conscious and environmentally aware Many stores and supermarkets now have large sections devoted to organic fruits and vegetables,positive
Contrary to what most people believe organic does not automatically mean pesticidefree or chemicalfree In fact under the laws of most states organic farmers are allowed to use a wide variety of chemical sprays and powders on their crops,negative
So what does organic mean It means that these pesticides if used must be derived from natural sources not synthetically manufactured Also these pesticides must be applied using equipment that has not been used to apply any synthetic materials for the past three years and the land being planted cannot have been treated with synthetic materials for that period either,negative
Most organic farmers and even some conventional farmers too employ mechanical and cultural tools to help control pests These include insect traps careful crop selection there are a growing number of diseaseresistant varieties and biological controls such as predator insects and beneficial microorganisms,negative
ORGANIC PRODUCE AND PERSONAL HEALTH,positive
When you test synthetic chemicals for their ability to cause cancer you find that about half of them are carcinogenic,negative
Until recently nobody bothered to look at natural chemicals such as organic pesticides because it was assumed that they posed little risk But when the studies were done the results were somewhat shocking you find that about half of the natural chemicals studied are carcinogenic as well,negative
This is a case where everyone consumers farmers researchers made the same dangerous mistake We assumed that natural chemicals were automatically better and safer than synthetic materials and we were wrong Its important that we be more prudent in our acceptance of natural as being innocuous and harmless,negative
ORGANIC PESTICIDES VERSUS SYNTHETIC PESTICIDES,positive
Clearly the less we impact our environment the better off we all are Organic farming practices have greatly advanced the use of nonchemical means to control pests as mentioned earlier,positive
Unfortunately these nonchemical methods do not always provide enough protection and its necessary to use chemical pesticides How do organic pesticides compare with conventional pesticides,negative
A recent study compared the effectiveness of a rotenonepyrethrin mixture versus a synthetic pesticide imidan Rotenone and pyrethrin are two common organic pesticides imidan is considered a soft synthetic pesticide ie designed to have a brief lifetime after application and other traits that minimize unwanted effects It was found that up to 7 applications of the rotenone pyrethrin mixture were required to obtain the level of protection provided by 2 applications of imidan,negative
It seems unlikely that 7 applications of rotenone and pyrethrin are really better for the environment than 2 applications of imidan especially when rotenone is extremely toxic to fish and other aquatic life,negative
It should be noted however that we dont know for certain which system is more harmful This is because we do not look at organic pesticides the same way that we look at conventional pesticides We dont know how long these organic pesticides persist in the environment or the full extent of their effects,negative
When you look at lists of pesticides allowed in organic agriculture you find warnings such as Use with caution The toxicological effects of organic pesticide X are largely unknown or Its persistence in the soil is unknown Again researchers havent bothered to study the effects of organic pesticides because it is assumed that natural chemicals are automatically safe,negative
WHY HAVENT WE HEARD THIS BEFORE,negative
For obvious reasons organic farmers have done little if anything to dispel the myth that organic  chemicalpesticidefree They would only stand to lose business by making such a disclosure,negative
Pesticide manufacturers have little concern in the matter To them synthetic pesticides sold and organic pesticides sold are both pesticides sold,negative
As for conventional farmers they are not really in a position to be critical It would not be in their interest to draw attention to chemical and pesticide use,negative
WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN,negative
The purpose in writing this article is not to discourage you from buying organic produce,positive
It is only meant to let you know what you are or arent getting when you make such a purchase Unless you know your grower personally there is no guarantee that your produce has been grown without pesticides or other chemicals Its a point to consider given the substantially higher cost of organic foods,negative
There are many choices and decisions that we as consumers are asked to make Hopefully this has provided some new information that you will find helpful,positive

Copy and pasting trolls dont change reality,negative
This is from A Mercola sponsored website Thats why I copy  paste To say organic pesticides are healthier or superior to synthetics is false  not backed by peerreviewed science I suppose you believe the Earth is flat  climate change is a hoax Google search Mercola science turns out he prefers pseudoscience Especially when he tried to sell healthy tanning beds,negative
Their goal is to ultimately bankrupt all farmers at the time of their choosing then BUY ALL OF THOSE FARMS  control the ENTIRE food supply These things are not a secret The Trilateral Commission has very clear cut strategies  goals They have been available to be read for over 40 years Hopefully we are not too late to make a difference,negative

Austin P Fink Youre a real piece of work arent you I hear Big Ag is paying people to do exactly what youre doing right now You should look into getting paid if youre not already The reality is that changing the genetics of a plant affects how it interacts with the microbiome of the soil which is critical But lets be honest if youre growing GMO crops you have no clue what a microbiome is for if you did youd never spray Roundup again Do you know what the pesticide my friend uses in his garden consists of Tobacco cayenne garlic apple cider vinegar Id drink that More than you can say for synthetic oil derived corporate fake food,negative
We lost control of the wheel a few decades back the ones of us paying attention are just as shocked as everyone else,negative

Sadly the area where Ive lived for the past 30 years has agreed to have Monsanto build a facility larger than life just to take over the farmers in the largest region of cotton growers in the US I saw the entire process happen This IS real folks So Very Real,positive

My brother fought along with many others   To try and stop Monsanto from using a huge acreage on the Gippsland highway between Trafalgar  and the city  Of course to no avail     At the time he stockpiled huge amount of assorted seed  from Tasmania where at that time banned genetically engineering of vegetation  My brother did this because he found he couldnt dry  his own tomatoes that he was once able to bought from super market    Because they would not grow,negative
Not sorry at all delighted to hear it and stick it to those,positive
What does Some sort of ban Actually mean,negative
Not sure its as all encompassing as we hope,negative
May their influence continue to decline until they disappear,negative
Monsanto needs to be disassembled as in a monopoly,negative
Goal is to control food and farmers who benefits if people get sick and cancer and other diseases thrive Big Pharma Drs Hospitals cancer Hospitals Heart Hospitals just to name a few,negative
Why is Monsanto still allow to be in business,negative

I dont think real but would be nice,positive
We need to isolate this company from the surface of the planet Know their products and boycott That will include the ethanol from GMO corn in the fossil fuels,negative

Why UK isnt on the map in green,negative
It isnt just Monsanto Its almost every Democrat and Republican in power How else could police go after young mothers protecting their kids from vaccines or chemotherapy Yet Monsanto goes around terrorizing other farmer trespassing into their property and creating a monopoly in the food industry Congress could have taken action long ago and instead they stay quiet because they really support Monsanto and think the alternative doctors and young mothers are misguided people who need the government to tell you everything to do,negative
They shouldnt be grown at all,negative
Even if they just take the subsidies away from GMO corn I think they would go out of business,negative
Drug companies make huge profits from all of this Also now that so many people have realized that Big Pharma is great in emergencies but for health care its terrible they pass the affordable care act to force everybody to buy from big Pharma Even if you decide not to get insurance you will still pay a fee to pay for other peoples insurance which only covers stuff like drugs and surgery,negative
Its not complety truein FRance for instance glyphosate is still allowed for the next 3 or 4 years,negative
Monsanto needs to be regulated and laws need to change,negative
Despite GMO are banned that doesnt mean they dont use ROUNDUP and guess what they label it as Organic product,negative

Dr Mercola I wish you  I could just take a tour with Monsantos scientists or any major seedchemical company  have a factual unbiased conversation with them If we continue to have this polarizing divide between organics  GMOs Im afraid our mutual goal of a sustainable future will NOT come to fruition,negative
Now thats what Im fighting for,positive
Sure wish we would ban their garbage in the US Our food is literally killing us,negative
Some part of mankind is waking up Hope there will be soon a critical mass to spell doom for Monsanto,negative
What the H is happening in The USA That countrys govt Is intent on destroying the natural course of Mother Nature and selling out to Corporate America,negative

Kudos to The Philippines   one of the most recent countries  in banning Monsanto from their country Jamaica lets go for it emotions among many of our people would change for the better Remember we are what we eat all of us,negative
Too bad North America is too stupid to ban them,negative
Mike Althouse it figures that the US is the biggest grower Uhhhgggg,positive
Glysophate causes cancer thats why theres class action lawsuits for farm workers happening now Glysophate ruins the soil and ground water thats not sustainable Glysophate causes weeds and pests to adapt becoming resistant to the amounts of the poison used in turn more of said poison must be used to combat the resistance Not sustainable Also your thought process is flawed and uninformed at best also not sustainable Cheers,negative
Organic produce has become increasingly popular in recent years as consumers have grown more health conscious and environmentally aware Many stores and supermarkets now have large sections devoted to organic fruits and vegetables,positive
Contrary to what most people believe organic does not automatically mean pesticidefree or chemicalfree In fact under the laws of most states organic farmers are allowed to use a wide variety of chemical sprays and powders on their crops,negative
So what does organic mean It means that these pesticides if used must be derived from natural sources not synthetically manufactured Also these pesticides must be applied using equipment that has not been used to apply any synthetic materials for the past three years and the land being planted cannot have been treated with synthetic materials for that period either,negative
Most organic farmers and even some conventional farmers too employ mechanical and cultural tools to help control pests These include insect traps careful crop selection there are a growing number of diseaseresistant varieties and biological controls such as predator insects and beneficial microorganisms,negative
ORGANIC PRODUCE AND PERSONAL HEALTH,positive
When you test synthetic chemicals for their ability to cause cancer you find that about half of them are carcinogenic,negative
Until recently nobody bothered to look at natural chemicals such as organic pesticides because it was assumed that they posed little risk But when the studies were done the results were somewhat shocking you find that about half of the natural chemicals studied are carcinogenic as well,negative
This is a case where everyone consumers farmers researchers made the same dangerous mistake We assumed that natural chemicals were automatically better and safer than synthetic materials and we were wrong Its important that we be more prudent in our acceptance of natural as being innocuous and harmless,negative
ORGANIC PESTICIDES VERSUS SYNTHETIC PESTICIDES,positive
Clearly the less we impact our environment the better off we all are Organic farming practices have greatly advanced the use of nonchemical means to control pests as mentioned earlier,positive
Unfortunately these nonchemical methods do not always provide enough protection and its necessary to use chemical pesticides How do organic pesticides compare with conventional pesticides,negative
A recent study compared the effectiveness of a rotenonepyrethrin mixture versus a synthetic pesticide imidan Rotenone and pyrethrin are two common organic pesticides imidan is considered a soft synthetic pesticide ie designed to have a brief lifetime after application and other traits that minimize unwanted effects It was found that up to 7 applications of the rotenone pyrethrin mixture were required to obtain the level of protection provided by 2 applications of imidan,negative
It seems unlikely that 7 applications of rotenone and pyrethrin are really better for the environment than 2 applications of imidan especially when rotenone is extremely toxic to fish and other aquatic life,negative
It should be noted however that we dont know for certain which system is more harmful This is because we do not look at organic pesticides the same way that we look at conventional pesticides We dont know how long these organic pesticides persist in the environment or the full extent of their effects,negative
When you look at lists of pesticides allowed in organic agriculture you find warnings such as Use with caution The toxicological effects of organic pesticide X are largely unknown or Its persistence in the soil is unknown Again researchers havent bothered to study the effects of organic pesticides because it is assumed that natural chemicals are automatically safe,negative
WHY HAVENT WE HEARD THIS BEFORE,negative
For obvious reasons organic farmers have done little if anything to dispel the myth that organic  chemicalpesticidefree They would only stand to lose business by making such a disclosure,negative
Pesticide manufacturers have little concern in the matter To them synthetic pesticides sold and organic pesticides sold are both pesticides sold,negative
As for conventional farmers they are not really in a position to be critical It would not be in their interest to draw attention to chemical and pesticide use,negative
WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN,negative
The purpose in writing this article is not to discourage you from buying organic produce,positive
It is only meant to let you know what you are or arent getting when you make such a purchase Unless you know your grower personally there is no guarantee that your produce has been grown without pesticides or other chemicals Its a point to consider given the substantially higher cost of organic foods,negative
There are many choices and decisions that we as consumers are asked to make Hopefully this has provided some new information that you will find helpful,positive

Copy and pasting trolls dont change reality,negative
This is from A Mercola sponsored website Thats why I copy  paste To say organic pesticides are healthier or superior to synthetics is false  not backed by peerreviewed science I suppose you believe the Earth is flat  climate change is a hoax Google search Mercola science turns out he prefers pseudoscience Especially when he tried to sell healthy tanning beds,negative
Their goal is to ultimately bankrupt all farmers at the time of their choosing then BUY ALL OF THOSE FARMS  control the ENTIRE food supply These things are not a secret The Trilateral Commission has very clear cut strategies  goals They have been available to be read for over 40 years Hopefully we are not too late to make a difference,negative

Obviously you know nothing of mining or growing cannabis Both are possible on the same piece of land,negative

Yes Jacob Lacy thats a very large base metal mine still in production and not rehabilitated Not what is proposed in the extraction of bauxite Bauxite forms from the tropical leaching of the soil making upland soils in Jamaica very poor and is concentrated in small pockets Operations happen in small but widely distributed areas so once rehabilitation has occurred the people of Cockpit will have a series of clearings linked by roadsnot as they have currently dense uncultivated jungle with little access and very poor soil,negative

When you grow up on a farm every farm kid wants to drive the tractor Thats the cool thing to do What I learned is that some days you drive the tractor and some days you scoop hog manure Thats work balance Throughout my career I have been able to take the bad with the good said Jeff Raikes in a recent interview Food for thought,positive
Whilst some things take generations to resolve I have no doubt we are well on our way We are already seeing dramatic increases in food production throughout the continent as our farmers are increasingly getting support  Its a generational fight you must finish We need some of you who started on the farm like Jeff Raikes to remember where you started and go back to build modern farms,positive
When I visited Jeff Raikes remarkable farm one of the thoughts that came to my mind was this Imagine what would happen if all of us who started out on the farm were to go back with our modern ideas and radically change agriculture like Jeff and his late brother did,positive
I know someone will quickly say to me that their rural family farm of two acres is too small for anything You should see what the Dutch and the Israelis do with just two acres  You can do anything if you allow your imagination to take a hold of the possibilities,negative

Agriculture probably offers the greatest opportunities of any industry even today Dont just look at it in terms of ploughing a field and growing something Look at it as a business and a vast industry that can absorb any type of skill When we visited Stanford we met young tech entrepreneurs who are working with satellites and big data from California to predict agriculture production in any African village without ever going there Its like Google Maps from space Soon if someone claims to have produced food when instead they pocketed the money these guys will be able to tell you,positive
One of my fastestgrowing businesses uses mobile phones to supply microinsurance to farmers We are making good money I tell you Its time for you to look at your business or career in the city and ask yourself what am I doing in agriculture,positive
We have to end this concept which some people have which is that a farm is a place to retire at the end of your career I hear so many people say When I retire as a civil servant I will go back to the village and become a farmer   Im sorry but that is the wrong mindset If you have a burning passion for agriculture go there now at the height of your strength   And if you think there is no money in it then I guess you are admitting youre not an entrepreneur,negative

When its comes to businesses it is always a big problems for most of the  entrepreneurs and farmers in Africa Apart from using local tools for farming which makes them using a lot of time and energy and end up harvesting very little than what they have invested it is also very hard to find a good markets for their crops  And the number one biggest problem for their crops are our own african governments  I am not blaming them but what iam real talking here  most of  them they are only there for farmers during the harvest time and think theyre helping them by telling them not sale their crops for this time or that time  or where to sale instead of helping them from the beginning,negative

Apparently I see much efforts of most African leaders trying their level best to strive this tragedy of Hunger Examples have been displayed already But I urge that governments and private sectors from developed countries should invest more in agriculture sector in Africa by employing more technologies build infrastructures and industries to make agriculture live to save many lives We expect to be having more hunger next year but we are still reluctant Let those who are educated teach us on how to fish than giving us food What will our future generation eat if we depend on AIDS We should know how to fish for future,negative

Food production and security has always been an issue in Africa The problem of importation and overrelying on imported food stuff could be addressed to help boost food production within Africa When the Nigerian government started fighting against rice importation people were complaining but varieties of rice were made available to farmers for cultivation and last month it was announced that rice importation had dropped by over 90 I was really happy when I heard that now Nigerian cultivated rice is appreciated and farmers are happy,positive

Pressing concerns for proper Green Revolution Africas agricultural and agribusiness limitations are many and include both the way goods  are grown and the way value is added In a report released by the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience at AGRF 2017 the fall armyworm  a large worm that spreads rapidly and destroys crops  has now invested 28 African countries The worm feeds on more than 80 crops and cut yields by up to 60  raising a substantial threat to agriculture output CABI estimates that the finacial cost of the work in just 10 of Africas mIss prouducing countries  could be as high as 55 bn a year Although many farmers are starting to use new technologies to counter environmental concerns such as disease resistant seed strains environmentally friendly pesticides and improved irrigation yields remain signicantly under their potential Finance is also a sizeable barrier to the uprising of small holder farms as financial institutions rarely find agricultural projects bankable in Africa As an alternative to banks more innovative methods of financing smallhopdings are beginog to emmerge especially with the abiquity I the smartphone and the greater Connectivity of farms Urbanisation and an ageing farmer population are also a concern causing a quickly depleting workforce Finally many raw commodities are being exported across the world and much of their potential value gets lost in the process,negative

WowThank you SMasiyiwa its a deep insight I believe that the changed mind can change unchanged generation,positive
absolutelythough its a long way to achieve that but i believe we can by uniting small holder farmersand this will help them start by owning tractors and other agriculture machines as communityand these machines will perform their work as a group and individually as they see it fitBut first thing first the best way to make the hoe become a museum is by uniting farmers after managing to unite them then is where we can make a step in agriculture,positive
strive show us and ill push it  in the town i stay where 70 are farmers,negative

To change Africa to a world leading food production is upon us we must change all our differences and have the love of Africa and passion to make Africa a better place for mankind to live in Why am I saying this how can someone gets trusted buy donors who are willing to help Africa change into a world class place to live in then gets away with the money of transformation project This is insane Africans are die yin because of our greediness and embezzlement of funds set for change we have to stop this before its too late Lets show our donors that we have love for Africa and we are willing to make a difference in African We all need a change for all of us not just individual change because we all gat problems as Africans so we have to put our efforts together and through the help of UN I believe Africa will change Even God will shower his blessings upon us God bless Africa Ameen,negative

I agree Sir African engineers should come up with smallscale tractors or any motorized tool to replace the hoe Because of the difficulty to mechanize agriculture in many highlands of africa sloping topography And I think its possible I have seen in tv a togolese engeneer who invented a machine called foufoumix that cooks ugali food made from cassava flour He said he was inspired when he saw his mother cooking ugali and how tiring it was So smallscale farmers in african highlinds should inspire african engineers in the same way so they can get motorized,negative

Good idea AGRA But but the implementation bit Workshops Workshops I call them talkshops typical of the NGO world majority of whom I refer as merchants of poverty The smallholder farmer is the face of philanthropy their poverty evokes emotions and loosens the wallets of the donors In the end 98 of the monies end up in the wallets of the socalled consultants expensive hotels fuel guzzling 4x4s flights and the smallholder farmer continues getting poorer of course the poverty will attract more donor money and the circus continues Any food secure country Strive Masiyiwa has not been fed by smallscale farming As long as you still sell the poor farmer as the panacea of Africas food security youre chasing a mirage,negative

Agriculture is key to economic development Besides food security the industry is labour intensive hence the ability to provide employment to most of our youths skilled semi skilled  none skilled Even then on its own agriculture cannot thrive without coopting enabler support sectors like industrialisation  technology innovation in order to achieve value addition of finished products Hence its imperative for African leaders to abreast themselves on much wider consultations if fruitful results can be realised from agriculture Moreover a much broad approach must be laid ahead since the sector is wide beef dairy hides horticulture fruits  a lot much more cash crops such as soya beans tobacco corn maize burley tobacco etc,positive

Indeed youre right sir and Im joining the fight Even the lands that our fellow Africans till with that ancient hoe are larger in size than the lands tilled with more advanced farming implements used in developed countries I believe our mindset has to keep changing to realise that not only large scale and medium scale commercial farmers in Africa can utilise and manage these implements but also small holder communal farmers Id love to see the Tractor and cultivator working the land rather than the laborious hoe to even make farming more efficient and enjoyable for the youths in communal areas I believe this will even reduce the massive ruralurban migration happening in some African countries,positive

As a family farmer who eats meat I can say without a doubt all livestock species need space and grass and sun and living in herdsflocks  Transport to slaughter is incredibly stressful  The best model Ive seen is bringing module abattoirs to the farm itself  To ignore the quality of life for animals and efficient death is not necessary  its only to keep the job easy and prices down  If you care about animals and eat meat find a local farmer and know their practices,negative
he same USDA that okd chicken to be shipped to China processed then shipped back to USAwe need a change in the leadership at the USDA,negative
Heartbreaking  All living beings deserve care and kindness  This is a terrible day for animals  Terminating the organic livestock and poultry practices standards is cruel and narcissistic,negative

Humane Society of the United States fellow Americans animal lovers anyone who reads this postcan ANYONE sort out for me why we are seeing the complete and total denigration of all things in this country that make life just a little easier for beast or human This is NOT a rhetorical question I would appreciate some answers Everyday upon reading posts on this medium I get angrier and angrier at the proposition that when we are rid of this administration it will take literally generations to fix all the backward policies put into place by Trump and his kabal,negative

The most vile administration in the history of America I cannot wait until every last one of them is gone,negative
The blame lies with voters who continue to keep the same people in our Congress  They make laws not Donald Trump  If you complain here but do not vote or fail to contact law makers you are guilty accomplices,negative
Nothing surprises me with this administration,negative
This was due to a push from the organic industry They have a bigger lobby than the NRA Selling you over priced food that creates a larger carbon footprint than traditional food,negative
Animal welfare is a partisan issue What a sad world we live in,negative
The most anyone can do for the sake of animals  is very simple  Dont eat them If there is no market the cruelty will end  dont blame Trump The blame is squarely with everyone who propagates this inhumane treatment of animals by eating their flesh There is no need to eat animals there are soooo many good and healthy alternatives  You want to call someone out  then stop eating animals you then would be in your right to do so,negative
While everyone is focused on the newest chaos in the White House Congress and several Departments are deregulating all of the things that protect us,negative
yes we need laws because otherwise animals will be abused for profit yes we consume animals but there is no need to abuse them and stress them out while they are alive It is unfortunate but YES we need laws to enforce rules because if we didnt  businesses would cut corners just to save a penny,negative
Nooo How could they do this,negative
Oh yeah here we go again Its Trumps fault  Maybe the Russians did it,negative

Evil prick Hes so harsh on animals and the environment,negative
The Trump administration always has a reason to abolish laws protecting the environment and animals He has been removing protections since he took office The sooner he is gone the better,negative

Kimberley Zampella Schulman this year  Just wait Lol,negative
Dont feed Kimberley if youd like to read her selection of talking points just view the comment sections at the top Youll eventually be called heartless or a sinner as she calls farmers law breakers who dont want these regulations anyway etc Pointless to engage Some people cant see that yes there are people that DO need the laws in place to treat animals kindly  which is how we got them in the first place Only a corporate stooge with no actual soul or care for a living being would advocate for the removal of its protections,negative
Oh yeah the IRS cant even tell me what the extra 24 Im getting every month is going to do up my taxes Yes there is a chance that we will end up owing because of this So no keep the 24 and let the animal live their short lives in more safe environments,negative

Yes  I agree This will force others to do the same  A law isnt going to matter Trying to get these people to have a heart change will   There is a law against speeding How many here do it Even 5 miles over if you have a heart to obey you wont  Or if its going to cost you also  Finding a local farmer helps him his family and may get others to do the same,negative

James Thompson do you speed  Even 5 miles over   Does the law stop you on the road   These laws will not do much If its going to cost more they will find a way  Why  Because people to include those slinging cruel names on here complain about the price of food  Its a never ending circle  We need a heart change towards people and animals,negative
Dear God do people have no voice in these things at all,negative
you will end up owing because of an extra 24 dollars a month  sweetie hire an accountant,negative
In the poll Gallup asked people from different political parties what they thought was morally acceptable Here is where the people fall on the issues related to animal rights The percentage shows the number that believe the act is morally acceptable,negative
Buying and wearing clothing made from fur  Democrats 54 Republicans 61,negative
Cloning animals  Democrats 34 Republicans 27,negative
Medical testing on animals  Democrats 58 Republicans 62,negative
As you can see and as I have pointed out in prior posts there is not much difference when it comes to views on animal rights when we break it down by political party People often tend to believe that the Democrats are somehow so much better for the animal rights movement This is simply not true,negative
Something else that is interesting is that Gallup reported there is a big gender gap when it came to supporting animal rights issues In fact they state The sharpest differences between men and women on these issues are not found on abortion or other reproductive matters but on three issues that involve the ethical treatment of animals,positive
Here are the gender differences when it comes to particular animal rights issues These percentages show the percentage of people who do find the behavior morally acceptable,negative

Every animal needs to be treated with loving care This shouldnt happen ever,negative
Ruth Francis I expect you are older even though you hate your face and wont show it so I figured you were like the older women on CNN asking why they didnt get a raise when everyone else was and she was on social security they had to explain it to them  Ill point out again since you cant read or comprehend that my sister got a raise and shes a teacher Although she is an excellent one that reads and comprehends,positive

Working on passing a lift of the ban on backyard chickens as well in my town Taking care of animals is an important part of understanding your impact on quality of life of those you buy  not to mention less expensive food and better quality over all  I want these laws  as an organic farmer  But it has to be both,positive
Trolls trolls trolls  Love my President,positive
It just gets worse every day For all of us and all the animals Tillersonget him out of thereNOW,negative
You cant impeach a president just because you dont like him If that were possible Obama would have been ousted too Do you really think Hiliary would have upheld these laws Please she had her own agenda as well Not all farmers abuse their animals Most organic farmers already treat their animals with the utmost kindness Factory farms are notorious for their cruelty Know your local farmers and choose local sources Not all Republicans and rightwingers are evil and greedy Demonizing human beings that do not share your world view will only encourage violence against them and since nobody is willing to compromise there will be volatile retaliation in an increasingly vicious circle Politicians work for all of us and there will always be times when they are pushing more to support their own personal agendas over others People got tired of ultraprogressive Liberals telling them how to live their lives and Hiliary was threatening more of the same If Trump can be impeached just because people dont like him then be prepared for that consequence with any future president that you might support,negative
I love the way people are blaming this on Trump when its the greed of the organic producers The consumer can control this with their wallets Do your research Only buy from those who still follow the original guidelines,positive
more proof they dont really care about what the majority of the public wantsso many examples of this  disturbing,negative
Thank you for caring for your animals in a humane and loving wayWe support and celebrate traditional farmers and ranchers who have humane standards for the sake of animals the land and local communities We would love for you to read about our rural development and outreach program and also our state agriculture councils,positive
Do you people honestly believe that anyone of either party runs the government in such a way that it truly benefits anyone other than themselves  I always look for independent organic certification on organic products I purchaseUSDA is really meaningless to me I think the government messes up everything they touch so they have zero credibilityDemocrat or Republican does not matter,negative
The Humane Society of the United States  I definitely follow you and other groups  Just signed up to be on our local agricultural board as we are rezoning this year and looking to establish an agricultural zone around our downtown area  Working through storm Skylar right now but count myself fortunate with only one branch on the fence line today,positive
Abuse of any animal should not be allowed,negative
This is very misleading  Being organic needs more than the farmer saying so  Lots of farmers that claimed to be organic actually were notthey charged more if it says organicso now it has to be redone to be fair to all farmersif you are organic you are now going to have to prove it not just claim you are  I think that is a good idea,negative

Well I believe that our administration is doing a better job than our past administrations as to bringing our country back to the way it used to be  In my opinion though people have just gotten more and more liberal with everything which I really think is making a lot of the population a more angry group than ever before  God bless America  We really need it,positive

How in the Heck did this post get so political  Can everybody just stop this rhetoric,negative

I only buy eggs that have the certified humane label on them  I do not see this label on beef pork poultry  That would be appreciated as we would know the animals were treated well,negative
Get with what this post is about  Not politics that you seem to know nothing about,negative
The Trump administration is destroying America All the programs many good and honest people crafted and worked for are being tossed out the window in favor of third world lobby efforts Its all for big business folks they are pushing all the family farmers out and soon the big conglomerates will be State Run Just like Russia Korea China just pick any dictator and this is all in the planbook,negative
The Dept of Agriculture is a sham Im seeing evidence of that here in Chicago,negative
Isnt there anything that we post on fb that doesnt turn political  It is very disheartening that it always turns to our President  The people of this nation chose him and those that voted for him need to be respected just as you would want to be respected,negative

We can still do something about this  we can just stop eating them,negative

I have stopped eating meat since I watched a documentary on 60 minutes showing how the livestock was being mistreated and even sick cows were being dragged into the slaughter house you could see the look of terror in their eyes,negative
Most evil administration along with Hitler,negative
Sorry but this country sucks I only eat organic and grass fed and I had hoped the standard would be raised for all livestock All animals deserve humane treatment regardless if they are being raised for food or whatever,negative
Thank you Pamela Paquin If it wasnt for family farmers like you I would starve,positive
I have absolutely come to despise this current administration and those who work under him  My heart aches for the destruction they are wielding to practices across the board,negative
Do they just look for anything that might benefit people or animals and just undo it They seem intent on reversing anything and everything that has been done in the past many years to help the environment and the creatures that inhabit it,negative
Another trump triumphmaking the world an uglier scarier place,positive
We have such a cruel heartless selfish White House,negative
No surprise though under our current administration,negative
Chiara M Chiara and consumers like you  I only feed myself and my neighbors and friends and always wish I could do more  but for now as the 4th generation of farmers I can contribute locally  I used to love bringing kids to my farm for educational trips  tracking droughts walking in the woods without lights at night and learning not to be afraid experiencing how to meet an animal where its at instead of forcing yourself into it while its held  and just where meat comes from  When I retire I really look forward to going back to that  stay safe if youre in the storm today,positive
The sad part is I dont think it would matter to him  He is just the devil in a suit,negative

Results of Trump in office  Animals and the environment are treated like crap  Hoping for impeachment to get that idiot out of office  What an embarassment he is,negative
How does this benefit anyone,positive
Yes our republic is at stake and that is why I am totally with the President who was put in place by the people who put him in office  I dont always like the way he speaks but he has done more good for our country and in a short time than any president I have seen in my lifetime  I see the evil in peoples hearts all around because their person didnt win  I saw our country almost being lost by our last president  And now our country is finally coming back to what it was years ago when we had a good economy a military to protect us from rogue nations being replenished and back to a God fearing nation I hope  There are so many people that are so mean to others because their beliefs are different  We are a country with a lot of different views on things but the hate I see in this country for its people disgust me  We should all respect the office of the Presidency and for our flag which a lot of people died for that flag which symbolizes the freedom we all have because of those people who gave their lives for it,positive
Jaime Goich Haha shame on you  I am crying now,negative
By the way I dont mean to go back to the 1950s  I sent that comment because I get sick and tired of so many people making things political all the time  I love animals a lot more than a lot of people to tell you the truth  If it is absolutely true that our President took a stand for cruelty of animals in any way I am against that policy  I just hate people making everything on fb a political forum,negative
so uninformed but they keep on talking,positive

I dont know what you mean by  God fearing I dont take my marching orders from a diety that exact punishment and fear on his believers,negative
Sadly you and the 30 that refuse to see we are losing our democracy will never change your minds Maybe when your president has finally turned our republic into a dictatorship you will wake from your fog I and a huge percentage of the populace dont feel we are represented by this president and that is unacceptable,negative
Ruth Francis dont tell me what I need to do I know you think you are God but you are not The sad part is you are no different then the people you call hateful You are a bitter woman what would really change the treatment of all animals is a heart change in people People being kind to each other something you dont seem to be able to do  How sad is it that we need laws to tell us to be kind to animals or each other Why is that  Because people like you call names and spread hate  Writing to the administration Starting a fund doing other things may get a second look Or rallying other animal lovers to stop buying  food in stores Go to humane farmers Order on line  But your answer is to attack  And thats why people have lost the ability to love each other and animals Look in the mirror and thank yourself and what you teach each time an animal is abused,negative
This is shamefull and dangereous for consumers to abandon basic animal welfare standards Sick malnurished and mistreted animals who do not eat right and are sick or injured are not only inhumane but allow for animal abuse as well Animals should be raised according to their natural needswithout pain and suffering I dont want to swallow animal suffering in my food,negative
I hope so Will believe it when I see it,positive
Who in the hell has this idea,negative
Why I will continue to buy local  Our Government is so effin effed up,negative
Apparently the government no longer cares what their citizens want,negative

Everything good thats been accomplished till now is being undone by this administration Why Eat animals if you must But cant they be treated humanely before and at slaughter,negative
Terribly sad More and more family farms are being shut down and run out by huge commercial farms If you want to support humane treatment shop local Buy from smaller farms who treat their animals with respect,negative
Good to hear there is at least 1 farmers who cares for their animals,positive
Until we butcher them and throw them on the bbq,negative
Ok so we need a really good humanely raised label They always end up highly scrutinized,negative
you cant care about animals and eat them like no Theres no humane way to eat meat  it doesnt matter how they are treated and it doesnt matter if they had a good life,negative
Just because people dont like him  Have you paid any attention to the number of indictments of those who surround him the disgusting unintelligent tweets the lack of respect he shows to anyone that doesnt suck up to him and agree with his every whim  You cant ignore facts forever This guy is a disgrace to our country and will be added to the list of indictments soon  best prepare yourself  The writing is on the wall He didnt cover his tracks well enough  Money laundering Russian collusion selling favors to foreign investors  Hes a con man  He said he was going to drain the swamp but HE IS THE SWAMP,negative
why does it matter if they are treated humanely if youre just gonna eat them if you want humane treatment dont kill for your meal,negative
Im done with wanting him arrested I want him GONE,negative
Its Trumps people that changed the restrictions so why wouldnt we blame him That made no sense,negative
Unless you do not consume meat get off of your high horse about treating animals humanely They have no idea they are raised for meat and if you treat them humanely theyll still die,negative
He is ruining this country and half the people dont even see it living in denial still believing he cares about them  So sad,negative
Maybe his people have too much power,negative
Blaming Trump will not gain you donations And last I checked plenty of Democrats are eating meat including veal So how about we work together as animal lovers and compassionate people regardless of politics and come up with a successful approach to help these helpless creatures,positive
USDA is such a horrible organization Untrustworthy and despicable money hungry demons,negative

Charlene Sherry Mulholland Charlene what would happen in nature if there were no predators scavengers and omnivores,negative
Ok  Good now that that is settled and you understand life would not exist without things that eat meat lets get to your main point if you love animals you dont wanna them  I agree I do t eat the animals I love  But  the aggressive ones I have no problem eating them And if youre a farmer if you live with herds and flicks you know there are always the ones that must go  Im not here to change your mind if your vegetarian and I really appreciate everyone that cares enough not to engage in mindless consumption  of animals or plants or any thing on earth  But for those who do eat meat  I hope they do it with as much kindness and consideration as possible  I was quite clear by making this statement I would receive comments like this here on this page  But my suggestion to you is when people you disagree with are offering to talk and take into consideration the welfare of animals as they live and die  not to attack them but to be grateful theyre trying and work to make more farmers like that  with 10 billion animals a year dying for our food  its super important we progress  Because the vast majority are not afforded grass and air and living in herds and most are transported for slaughter  So when farmers are trying to make that system better its not a good idea to attack them Youll slow down progress,neutral
Bryana Merchant how do you justify working at Target where meat of the lowest quality is sold and having your opinion You represent and support their business by taking their money  Dont get me wrong everyone is a hypocrite in one way or another  but thats the point stones in glass houses and all that,negative
Trudy Der Kinderen there are many more  part of what makes it hard for farmers to choose practices are rules about no slaughter on farms for food safety reasons taxes on land that make it hard to have enough pasture to graze  Ive never fully understood why male calves are killed as babies for veal  but of course if we want the milk the calves cant take it  such large scale systems are really messy  Almond and Soy milk are terrible for the environment  but there is a brand called Oatly from oats that is much less damaging and a new and great option  We all just have to keep going,negative
Susan Tyndal   that is so good for them as well  Its really exciting to see pet owners taking back the food for their pets into their own hands  Watching those videos had the same effect on me  Thank god for internet groups with information and recipes on it,positive
The USDA Is disappointing on many levels  This is just one more,negative
All creatures should be treated with kindness care,positive
Josephina De Caters because I would like to see people be kind to animals without someone forcing them  Because instead of being hateful the HSUS and its followers have a huge number to protest this action But choose to come here and attack each other  What part of that is pathetic This woman has attacked me throughout this article,negative
Trump and his crew have all this time on their hands to overturn all of Obamas Executive Orders mostly out of spite why arent they taking care of our American Citizens in Puerto Rico who are still without clean water power and housing Instead hes picking out drapes and floor coverings for the wall Deplorable,negative
The consumer can control this Money is god Spend yours in ways that can help the animals Educate yourself But from local farmer Dont buy cheap chicken from Perdue Tyson etc For all the Trump blamers on here are YOU doing YOUR part to create a better world for animals  Still buying cosmetics tested on animals  You always looking for the best bargain on meat at Walmart  You are part of the problem Stop blaming the politicians Take responsibility for your choices,negative

Ive never been afraid of our government  Until this administration,positive
I know this wont be popular but the best way you can protect animals is to stop purchasing their meat and milk Stop writing the checks that support these businesses Plant based eating is surprisingly easy Its more healthy for you and your family There is as much protein in brocolli as in beef One person going vegan saves approximately 200 animals each year,negative
So wrong thats why Im slowly not eating meat,negative

I dont think this is the greed of organic producers I rather suspect that nonorganic producers now see the demand for organic and want to get in on it but not with all the restrictions It is they who probably lobbied for thisand won because they are well big corporations,negative

HSUS provide some talking points   The link is to FEDERAL comments  If you want us to help provide us with the data   Otherwise a comment can be a bit too simple like mine  Do NOT outsource Animal Welfare Act inspections to private entities or third parties  This outsourcing would allowing various animal use industries to police themselves and the reason the regulation exists is because these entities do NOT police themselves   Outsourcing Animal Welfare Act inspections which is a duty of the government under law would be harmful indeed disastrous for the welfare of animals kept in puppy mills roadside zoos research facilities and animalrelated events eg horse shows and rodeos   Please do not outsource these inspections,negative

Utahs Bureau of Land Management is preparing for a possible rush of mining claims in the area opened up by Trumps decision to reduce the size of the Bears Ears and Grand StaircaseEscalante National Monuments Millions of acres of land will soon be open for mining claims governed by an 1872 law describing the process for prospecting and staking claims in the western United States Once the decision goes into effect on Feb 2 the area will be subject to gold silver copper and uranium mining claims,negative
This is not what the tribes recommend,negative
The hair doesnt have to be splitZinke as head of the DOI manages 507 million acres among them hundreds of dams reservoirs over 400 National Parks monuments seashore areas and national wildlife refuges  If the US Forestry Service doesnt set foot on any of these where are THEIR 154 national forests 20 national grasslands and 222 research and experimental forests that encompass 192 million acres of public land  Just curious,negative
Thats what the Ojibwe said about the North Woods,positive
If you think distinctions between grazing oil  gas timber mining watershed power generation recreation  natural preservation activities on public land is splitting hairs then I guess youre right,negative

William Stronk If Im a tool make mine a hammer,negative
William I understand how you feel but I dont think Im wasting my breath encouraging people understand how public land is allocated and managed,negative
Granted there are many who dont want to understand the roles and responsibilities of BLM or USFS  It is indeed very complicated  There are fewer still that want to become involved through public commenting processes  It seems many just want to consume a steady diet of environmentalist BS so they can post  Zinke must go over  over while not having a clue as to what his job entails,negative
But I have had conversations with a couple people who are willing to learn about these agencies and not just swallow the easy leftist media crap then spit it back out everytime the DOI posts scenery,negative
So Im a little encouraged here and there,positive
My disclaimer is that I am far from an expert in public land management the more I learn the less I seem to know  But I do  deal with some of this as part of my job,positive
Good to hear Alex  Unfortunately there are some Ive seen responding negatively to DOI pictures who dont know the difference between national forests national parks and national monuments,negative

Then one of the first things you should hear Jim Brewer is that you should not try to impose your viewpoint about what it is that others want to know or consume  By doing so you underestimate your fellow citizens  Granted few people take the time to understand the distinctions of Fed hierarchy  as evidenced by the comment about the Foerstry Service  You should know however that despite the fact that the US Forest Service is administered under the Dept of Ag its budget is still a part of the Dept of Interiors allocation  Thereby their policy is influenced by priorities set by Congress for the Dept of Interior  When you presume that the public is naive or uneducated  listening only to a steady diet of environmentalist BS you disrespect your fellow American by assuming that its beyond their understanding  Truth is what it comes down to is the constant state of inconsistency in resource organizations despite the lifelong dedication of most of their employees One cannot be held resonsible for the health  welfare of their patch if policies  priorities change yearly or wdifferent administrations  Especially when dealing with resources that range from a 40yr lifecycle eg trees to an irreplaceable resource like oil or copper  So quit calling it easy leftist crap until youve learned more  please,negative
I will join you Lynne,positive
Stop the corporate profit madness already,negative
Gloria Robbins   Ill start here  you said You should know however that despite the fact that the US Forest Service is administered under the Dept of Ag its budget is still a part of the Dept of Interiors allocation,negative
It took me 15 seconds on Wikipedia to find out thats not true,negative
You then admonish me for presuming the public is naive or uneducated and excoriate me until Ive learned more,negative
Look I dont underestimate anybody and although I might be caustic in my responses to zinke nazi posts I will always offer to help anybody learn more about how public land organizations work  usually because when Im challenged Ill go learn more too,positive
But in much less time it took for you to lambaste someone youve never met on a public forum you could have looked at the reference here to know that Bob was wrong,negative
I guess Im coming around to William Stronks viewpoint,positive
Forest Service is still allowed to talk about climate change  Why arent you US Department of the Interior,negative

fair point Luke indeed your right these mechanized practices allow us to farm much larger areas more efficiently than before But then you have to be able to fertilize and keep that large area of crop safe from pests etc using a reduced workforce hence the mass use of chemical fertilizer  insecticide which runs into the streams and messes up all the wildlife etc but that is a different argument You do have to wonder what happened to all those farm workers though Farming used to be a way of life a large community  from my own limited perspective in the UK ive seen it dwindle away since just the 1980s  many rural villages are now second homes for wealthy londoners due to the lack of work available,negative

NOT labor shortages but WAGE shortagesand why they hire illegals so they pay them pennies instead of minimum wages required by lawhow the US became the illegal capital of the worldthey give them everything and deny American citizensand why libtards bow and whine for them while they have them being their maids and gardenersyeah Demorats,negative

Equality and wealth distribution will free us from poverty not robots What do you think about the richest 1 owning half the worlds wealth  What about the wars,positive
Syd Hall who do you mean,negative
Harley Haynes The future is now homie,positive
Michael Studiomtn Nguyen that is a false statement that the old jobs will be replaced by the same number of new jobs Even if that was true then whats the point There will be no motivation because the net effect is no increase in efficiency Efficiency means less jobs As we increase our efficiency the shift to new industry creates even fewer jobs than it destroyed Eg at JPMorgan their COIN project just takes seconds to process contracts that takes 360000 lawyer hours to complete,negative

Robots are the future farm handlers To fill in jobs that nobody wants I am a farmer and find its hard to get or replace farm workers The life of a farm handler is tough Only few younger generation are intetested in farming Land lease become too expensive for new farm operators I dont think the number of land for farming would grow Farmers need to maximize productivity if they want to stay in the game Everyday I see people are giving up farming Im not surprise if one day we rely on engineered food Wages are bad in agriculture that i certainly agree But thats because farmers only earn pay dirt,negative
Yeah the can change the future but putting humans out of a job big freaking deal I see nothing good about this at all,negative

Michael Studiomtn Nguyen are you assuming those jobs can never ever be done by machines either The people who get a new job building and maintaining the machines will likely be out of work again in another decade Automation moves faster than people expect and can do more than people assume,neutral
A human life is not defined by work,negative
The transition will be difficult maybe impossible but a world where no one works is a possible outcome if we make it through,negative
Pretty sure automation preceded black mirror black mirror just capitalises on peoples paranoia of it,negative

Eventually this machines will eliminate labor workers the problem is that machine is not a consumer and human workers are consumers money goes and come back 100 poor people consume more than 1 rich and thats what makes the difference,negative
Frankie Fuentes agreed  we need to all profit from these creations if only we automatically received a share of the machines earnings if they replaced us  its naive to discuss without a real understanding of how this could be implemented  into the business world but the current business models are far too open for exploitation and really should be changed right now anything goes and monopolization is rife,negative

Two climate change  it is happening West Texas knows this but what are you going to replace combines tractors and other farming equipment with when you cut down on coal and oil  You dont have a machine to date that can replace the torque of farming equipment  These are radical changes you want implemented now you need a strategy first  Right now people just see you digging into the pockets of people to help feed the government income for healthcare and college,negative

If he hadnt got cheated out of the nomination he would be your president now,neutral
The question should be do we have a chance without Bernie Sanders in 2020 This really gets to me Bernie Sanders gets more done on accident then most congressmen do on purpose He has more energy than any Senator in office today the man is a human dynamo His political opinion is sought out by every world media source He is responsive to every media event and crisis There are only two critical and valuable factors that come into a persons life with time Experience and wisdom and both of these qualities are what makes Bernie Sanders irreplaceable,positive

I would love to see Utah transition to a politically progressive majority but it seems a pipe dream for now In this state the legislature is overwhelmingly partisan and gives little discretion to left wing ideology It has proven to have major environmental and cultural ramifications for the state Thankfully we have Salt Lake City boundless geographic beauty and tons of recreational opportunities as well The state legislature is very partisan and corrupt nonetheless,negative

Carolina Cameron  You wrote Bernie felt like he was going to beat Hillary before he thought he could turn Texas blue I understand that is your opinion but can you cite any supporting evidence for that statement You also wrote the liberals keep getting their illegal immigrants in this country Oh like no illegals ever entered the country during Republican administrations Whatever,negative

Nothing is going to change if people dont show up to vote,negative
Elizabeth Ann LMAO cthe American voters rejected the fake democrat care you really so foolish that you expected democrats to vote for a fake democrat and a socialist Bernout e screwed himself Bernie is an establishment politician who invests in mutual funds that that invest in fracking Wall Street and mega corporations That is why when he released his 2014 tax return he refused to release the pages that identify his sources of income That is why he refused to release his financial disclosure statement and still hasnt done so Hillary VOLUNTARILY released more than 39 years of COMPLETE tax returns and posted the eight most recent years on her campaign website Hillary VOLUNTARILY released her financial disclosure statement in 2015 Hillary had nothing to hide What is Bernie and Crooked Jane hiding  It must be horrible Bernie is the corporate whore That is why he conceals his financial information,negative

Joanna Smith actually we beat Trump by 3000000 votes Hillary had the second largest popular vote win in history She also beat Bernie by more than 3850000 votes American voters rejected Bernie and his faux revolution We democrats will do it again in 2020,positive
read some history Bo  Party philosophy changed greatly during the 20s 30s 40s etc and by the 1960s and the Civil Rights movement the Southern Democrats left the party to join the Republicans  their stance changed to what it is now  Originally the Dems in the 1850s had the hell bent GOP philosophy but now the Republicans have completely changed their philosophy  Lincoln would never be a Republican now  In theory the Dems you talk about with the KKK were the Republicans since the parties changed  Look at Trumps father who was part of that fine organization,negative
You first have to beat the corporate members of the Democratic Party and thats impossible when they are willing to change the rules when needed Good luck,negative
Joanna Smith actually he had more in his war chest in 2016 and he lost Hillary raised more than he did but she donated one third of it to down ticket Democratic candidates and she donated one third of it to the Democratic Party Bernie refused to support down ticket Democratic candidates One of the many reasons why we democrats rejected Bernie in 2016 We will do it again in 2020 BTW Prove your claim that he has millions in his war chest That will be difficult for you to do because he refuses to say how he spent his campaign donations We know that he spent 600000 of those donations to charter a private jet for him and his entourage to fly to the Vatican What a waste of donations Unethical I will be waiting for your evidence to prove how much he has in his war chest Dont fail on this I really want to see your proof,negative
Elizabeth Ann give it a break  I supported Bernie financially too but he will not win  He will not be running as a Democrat as he changed back to an Indie  There is no way that Biden or young Kennedy wont get the nod to run given they have given their lives for the party for decades  Bernie will not beat either one of them  Its time to understand for all of us that if Bernie divides the vote runs as an Indie he will get nowhere  Bernie lost to Clinton by almost 4 million votes and he would not have beaten the red states who have more voting power nor would he have changed the russian interference,negative
Joan E Gates thank you Joan But is impossible to educate Bernie supporters,negative

Bernie you arent even Blue talk about the ultimate sell out Why dont you make it official and join the democrats party The party whose leaders would shut the government down to not work on immigration Debate the 4 pillar plan which is a guarantee  of an additional 1 million people 45 proposed as a path to citizenship You would put the Democratic Party over a 18 people who as kids were brought to this country Why because their parents thought it was worth the risk for their childrens future How dare you talk red and blue when you should go one on one with President Trump and work out the deal Thats what leaders do not play politics Im ashamed on how you melted into the establishment Coward,negative

Houston has 43 hispanic and 23 AA You know they need to vote this time and next In my school district the kids are pretty upset Young people arent fooled so easily anymore,negative
Dems will not win Texas and America doesnt need Texas to turn blue This is the problem with Democrats is that they have this mob gang mentality that everyone needs to think exactly like them and the world would be a better place because they are so much more morally pure than other parties The facts are you guys neglect everyday Americans and pigeon hole yourselves with small groups ie illegal immigrants LGBTQ and push these peoples concernsrights ahead of common Americans,negative
The constant hammering of the top 1 is earning too much as well Are we not all striving for our families to make the most money as possible Most households that make up this magical top 1 Im not talking Coca Cola or Walmart help there families which comes from their pockets So maybe stop using this scapegoat of the top 1 as the evil thats causing this country to fall into this apocalyptic and maybe look into that your policies are no good,negative
Take this for surface value most Americans saw more money in their pay checks this year than during any other administration prior Is that a bad thing I would hope democrats would say no but I dont think that is the case,negative
why blue  why red  why not Green,negative
While I definitely want better candidates in the Dem party I agree with the purity thing I see way too many people who write off candidates completely because of that one time they took money from pharma or that one policy that isnt strictly liberal People need to compromise at least a tiny bit,negative

A democrat incumbent candidate in Illinios is antichoice antilgbt equality anti healthcare pro war in the pocket of Wall Street and votes with republicans a majority of the time  So stop demanding people dont care about the issues and vote label only  People lie about their labels all of the time and voters need to start looking at where candidates are on the issues and if they walk the talk  Fortunately he has a opponent named Marie Newman who is a real democrat but if people just listened to this and only care about label nonsense the republican who claims a d label would never be voted out  Issues matter and people need to pay attention,negative

Cliff Arnold mindless Cliffy is intellectually incapable of presenting relevant rebuttal Another bottom feeder I am a lifelong liberal democrat as were my parents before me I refuse to vote for draft dodger socialists and Commies Bernout Slanders started masquerading as a democrat in 2015 He didnt fool us That is why Hillary beat Slanders by more than 3850000 Even Trump got more votes in the primaries than Bernout did Bernie lost to everyone He will never be the nominee of the Democratic Party and he will never be president Thank God,negative

Bo Burlison It was always more of a regional issue than a partisan onebasically the Southern Democrats who founded the KKK and fought for slavery did so because they were Southern not because they were Democrats,negative
Nearly everyone in the South was racist encompassing not just the Souths Democrats but also the Souths Whigs and the Souths KnowNothings The Whigs and KnowNothings were less well organized so they dissolved after the Civil War leaving only the Democrats around which the Southern racists could coalesce Otherwise the Souths Whigs could quite plausibly have taken up the mantle And throughout all this many of the Norths Democrats disagreed with and opposed the Souths Democrats on those racial issues,negative
You also see this dynamic in the congressional votes on the Civil Rights Act of 1964every Democrat who opposed it was from the South while every Democrat from the North supported it as did a few Southern Democrats Meanwhile every Southern Republican opposed it as did a few Northern Republicans So the only Republicans who supported it were from the North the only Northerners who opposed it were Republicans every Democrat who opposed it was from the South and the only Southerners who supported it were Democrats,negative
Well nearly everyone everywhere in the country back then was racist in some way despite the Emancipation Proclamation Lincoln still expressed some prejudiced remarks about AfricanAmericans but the Southerners tended to be more violently racist,negative

Charlie Marceau Their are a lot of unfortunate circumstances regarding Argentina And I am not going to write you a book on Argentina or Vermont I will say look an Germany and all of nothern Europe Unless you are extremely wealthy its hard to deny their high standard of living They have an excellant standard for the middle class When tarveling immerse yourself in other cultures experience different people and life styles and broaden your perspective on other cultures America has socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor and the struggling,negative

I dont eat meat so Im not personally concerned about the crap they serve at fast food restaurants which I dont patronize,negative
Because the actual article linked doesnt even mention fast food,negative
Maybe Im not understanding what Sabrina means by original poster I take it to mean who posted the image perhaps she means the article which is unrelated to the image,negative

Absolutely  We do have standards and regulations here too of course but its taken some time for the American consumer to get wise to the fact that industrialized agriculture actually puts the well being of the customer pretty much dead last in the equation  Over time however people have gotten wise to this and are starting to spend their money on wiser choices thus forcing the market to adapt  It wasnt long ago that if you said the words organic or non GMO etc you would have been looked at like some kind of a nut  Now even the average supermarket has organic choices even entire organic sections  Its not a specialty item anymore  Were still not as up to speed as the EU which has banned GMOs in everything altogether but were getting there,negative
the funny thing isorganic is just normal food as we had in our garden when I was a child and now its something special,positive

Narendra Modi Ji Why ur BJP central team silent for Gorkhas Why ur BJP Party not doing complete promise made to Gorkhas for Long pending demand Gorkhaland in BJP Menifesto 2009  2014,negative
Human Rights Violation in Darjeeling,negative
As expatriate Indian citizens who belong to the Gorkha Community we are in great distress and anguish over what people in Darjeeling have been subjected to in the past few weeks The gross human rights violations that the peace loving Gorkha communities are facing are uncalled for and inhumane,negative
In a democratic country like India where diversity in culture language and religion are celebrated on a daily basis even the suggestion of forceful imposition of a second language over the mother tongue has been unheard of Which is why the implication that Bengali as a language would be imposed on all communities in Darjeeling District has been shocking,negative
For far too long the Gorkhas have been subjected to distressing and unacceptable proposals such as this causing violent and regular protests in these regions For us living in the United States far away from everything that we hold dear seeing the brutalities on TV and social media makes us feel helpless,negative
In the past few weeks three innocent bystanders have been killed and hundreds more have been injured during peaceful processions by the armed forces The atrocities by the state government have adversely impacted our tourism a major source of livelihood for people in Darjeeling In addition the State Government has successfully cut communication of all forms including transport to and from the entire district impacting hundreds of schools colleges businesses and even medical facilities,negative
Now politically backed goons are destroying and cutting off food supplies to the hills and no action has been taken on these people,negative
While India is actively promoting advancement of technology in the country through Digital India the Gorkhas have now lost freedom to access the Internet from 3 Jun 2017 The continuing apathy of the West Bengal government to the current situation does not surprise a Gorkha anymore because they have faced this for decades,negative

Now herewith I would like to submit here my two submissions in about the part of my Village ie Talara of Okhlisirodh These are as below,negative
The Road to Talara We are suffering lot due to non availability of Road to Talara As you know at the time of our former honorable Prime Minister Mr Atal Bihari Bajpai it was passed that each village and part of village must be connected with NHAI and main cities of State under the provision of Pradhanmantri Sarak Yojaja and Pradhanmantri Gram Vikas Yojana but the part of my village is still kept away from this facility Some time back Mr Bahadur Ram Tamta the former District commission of Delhi and MLA of congress got the road up to his house with the help of Mr Narain Dutt Tiwari the former Chief Minister of Uttarakhand and we are just 89 kilometer far from his house but the road not extended further because we dont have any approach to reach to the chief minister or prime minister so we kept out away from the facility Nobody is there who will listen to us several times we approached the block development officer through the Sabhapati but nothing happened Mr Gajat Singh on behalf of us meeting with these officials frequently but they are not doing anything So my submission to you is please allow the road which is as of now only up to Mr Bahadur Ram Tamta house to be extended further to my house and further to Shea the another village or to be connected with the Sheraghat Road,negative
My second submission is the water provision other village people with the help police facilitated with the water through our land the water facilitated to them through the line lined toward their village through our land and in between our village is there but they didnt gave a connection to us whereas used our land for the water and the water gone there from our forest so our submission is that please allow us a water connection from this line which is going the that village through our land For the same we fought lot but no action done Thanks with Regards,negative
herewith I am enclosing this mail to pmo office also because lot of fund already released for rod and village development and also during this budget session Mr Jately announced lot fund for Road connectivity for village To the and village development,negative

Big thanks to Japan Also you are kindly requested to engage with the Iraqi Government to provide generous contribution to rehabilitate under your supervision the Baiji fertilizers factory and restore its design capacity This project would support the agriculture sector mainly in the areas that have recently been liberated and retaken from Daesh terrorists As you may know Ninawa was the bread basket of Iraq through production of wheat and barely as well as other crops which have severely been damaged by the terror acts Thanks again,positive

We are so happy to see the kind of excellent job that the Japanese corporations are doing in Iraq especially in the fertilizer plant in Basra There is a similar plant built by the same company in Beiji that suffered from destruction and looting by ISIL militants on behalf of the Iraqi people generally and Salah Al Deen Province people particularly we kindly request that the government of Japan may consider rehabilitating this plant knowing that this plant used to feed thousands of families by hiring their sons to work in it Those employees are without jobs now We are so happy to see the rule of the empire of Japan in Iraq and we will be more happy to see The Japan touch in Salah Al Deen province,positive

Raise Cows and dont eat them,negative
I eat meat as my environmental duty Bulletproof ecology,positive
And just let their population boom to the point of becoming a problem,negative
But seriously Dave please write a book called Bulletproof Ecology Im sure Im not the only one who would read the heck out of that,negative
we raise dogs and cats and dont eat them humans are smart we can control the animal population,negative
Need more a2 cows not a1 holsteins,negative
Yes and good luck finding enough land to graze them all on Americans would have to drastically reduce their meat and dairy consumption in order to support this model Grass fed meat raised in small farms is at this point only for people with money or more money than what the majority of fast food is feeding which is low income families in food deserts Encouraging a vegan diet is good in that it will hopfefully get folks to reduce overall meat and dairy consumption Which if done properly is just as healthy as a properly done omnivore diet Also calcium is available in plants b12 is easily supplemented if needed,positive
I live in Canada and what you see on most farms is corn and soybeans Not for human consumption  but to fatten up pigs and cows I guess   grass fed animals that are given a decent life and killed for the survival of your family I can live with Theres nothing as far as vitamins thats lacking in a vegan diet only b12 thats found in the soil that animals eat When we used to drink from streams b12 was plentiful now that weve progressed its an easy fix to take a supplement,negative
the land area alone needed to grass feed the amount of meat people eat is not feasible Better off encouraging a mostly plant based diet with a little meat and or dairy if wanted but very sparingly,negative
Dave Asprey 73 of the beef market is used burgers or mince  start ups like Gates funded  Impossible Foods can produce better tasting plant based burgers using  GMO yeast ferment taste components that replicate the beef taste perfectly  We all know the burger chains will feed us anything  especially at half the cost  There are 20 of these start ups with 3 billion combined funding  With a loss of the burger mince mince market steak prices will skyrocket and we can revert the land to its proper purpose,negative
Thats the good thing about freedom of choice we dont ALL have to be Vegans only those who choose to be These hypothetical situations will not happen in our lifetimes as long as we can still choose what to eat,positive
Do you have a breakdown of the nutritional content vs a real meat burger,negative
Here is another one  The nutritional issues im can be a engineered to nearly anything the example though is yet another silicon alley start up distracting a massive traditional market through innovative be use of technology,negative
Poop is basically decomposed at least for cows plant matter Cows are definitely not necessary for this purpose industrially speaking Although granted there are tradeoffs with everything,negative
I can smell the unintended consequences from here Soylent blue yellow or green anyone,negative
No one claims that we should eat like ruminants,negative
Or wolves to my knowledge,positive
Well it might work for population control,negative

Pamela Jeanne Harmon Soylent is anothe Bill Gates start up,positive
Steve George I know but the point is not whether its good for you its whether it will happen anyway whatever we think   I wouldnt touch it past my initial sample but the burger chains wont care whether it has good omega levels or inflammatory ingredients,negative
The argument presupposes that because we stopped slaughtering animals for food they somehow wouldnt be around to collect manure from,negative
I seriously hope no one is truly entertaining eating engineered fake meat I once have had to seriously talk a patient out of continuing to eat Quorn  probably another brainchild of some  entrepreneur who wanted to save the world Please,negative
Roman Krupa I think its highly probable that it will happen and happen at scale  Remember its a very small community that has any idea about nutrition so the barriers for it happening are extremely low,negative
Dude you havent been eating like a wolf are you ok,positive
Sharing the things i read Shelby James,positive
Steve George what is bad about the ingredients list Succinic acid is a chemical our bodies makes during the process of converting glucose to energy Acetic acid is vinegar Ascorbic acid is vitamin C I eat meat and I limit processed foods in my diet However I have a difficult time understanding your argument Could you elaborate,negative
Gabrielle Nichole Wilhelm just some info,negative

The point though is not whether we would eat it but whether the people that consume 88billion burgers annually  95 of which isnt grass fed anyway,negative
We dont give shelter to homeless people Why would we do it for free to animals,negative
If only there was some other way other than using livestock to turn plant matter into fertilizer,negative
I tried for a while but my genetics arent cut for longevity though a vegan diet My relatives and ancestors stayed young and fit by eating primarily meat obtained though hunting a necessary practice here and fatty fish and local Alaskan plants I cannot consume sugar grains starches additives or soy or most nuts so it narrows down my options quickly,negative
Though I do support my vegan counterparts and the ethics of what they are trying to accomplish They bring balance which in my opinion is very important,positive
I live on cocanut milk fruit and goats cheese and greens and rice i still running around all day no problems at 57 it feels good to have a light body,positive
Food isnt created in a lab just like people arent created in a lab  its called innate life force  that makes humans and food,negative
Never found in a lab,negative
Animals live in the wild They were there before we came around theyll be there after,negative
Some of us cannot consume nightshades,negative
There are those who feel that killing animals for food is cruel They forget that animals kill each other  eat each other alive What about hunting  eating deer pheasant turkeys ducks  the like If we didnt use animals for food where would we put them all Eating meat for a time is even Biblical People dont reason things out anymore,negative
Melanie Moore I believe in eating real whole unprocessed foods That fake meat is not real food 100 grass fed beef is real food Good for our body Good for our environment Very simple to me,positive
Im not in the cult of vegan But I use animal poop myself Rabbit from our bunnies horse poop from the local police horse barn and occasionally cow poop Nearby sanctuaries also let people have poop,negative
I did not forget that animals kill each other No one forgot that animals kill each other EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET knows about the food chain,positive
this is why im vegan free asprey,negative
Thats my question Dave answer this,positive
EXACTLY the question i was going to propose but made sure to see if someone else asked first it is absurd to think animals would disappear if we stopped using them for food literally that makes no sense,negative
Emily Lawless there are a lot of people in complete denial to how cruel Mother Nature can be,negative
They forget that animals kill each other Give me a break And the vast majority of food animals are bred to be food animals Where would we put them all Well we wouldnt breed them so there goes that problem Hunting wild animals that overpopulate without any predators Fine As for the rest so much for people reasoning it out anymore,negative
Wow leave it to a food debate to bring out the dumbs  Christie what planet do you live on Because I live on one where we do give shelter to homeless people and to animals for free Hell I let animals sleep in my bed and cater to their every sadfaced plea And still sheltering animals is not relevant to the comment Are you aware that wild animals survive without the help of shelter from humans,negative
Vegans often conveniently forget about the entire ecosystems that are destroyed in order to clear land to plant all these grains that sustain their diet,negative
You can pry the steak from my cold dead hands,negative
So plants are ok to killnever did understand this ethics argument life is life Respect all life Lots of plant life has a higher and more compleated DNA then Humans It is all about easing  the guilt being a vegan will do nothing to save the earth,positive
Most  farm animals are not evolved to go wild,negative
And they certainly arent going to have space,negative
Well right not if you put the hog at the corner of Madison and 53rd st in manhattan Almost 50 of the continental United States is empty space where no one lives Thats a lot of space,negative
Grass fed is great until winter hits,positive
This guy gets disqualified for having an actual informed discussion on this from the outset with this sentence Apart from the fact that a plantbased diet lacks key nutrients to keep you running at full power That tells me he knows NOTHING about vegan dietsI have friends that have raised their kids vegan and they have never had illness due to their diets See the link below on vegan NBA athletes Wow how can they perform as top level professionals in their sport on a vegan diet  Moron As for the no fertilizer argument thats like saying what will we do with the animals if we dont eat them  They were all once wild  I dont know much about fertilizer and havent studied the issue so I cant give an informed opinion But the idea that our species cannot survive without domesticated animals raised for meat has no factual basis I would also look further into this persons background Nine times out of ten they have ties to the meat and dairy industries in one way or another  I dont know this guy but if you find any ties at all to these industries be very suspect of his opinion,negative

Luke Jepson we have stricter noise limits from 11pm as most festivals do however it is the way in which we will be managing the on site noise that has changed dramatically this year Last year on the Saturday night we were put under a lot of pressure and were not as prepared as needed but a big lesson learnt for this year and a huge amount of time and focus from highly qualified industry professionals will be going in to avoiding negative impact on the crowd experience while maintaining limits off site for the local residents We will be aiming to release more information on this as it is important everyone is clear change has been made So in brief we do have noise limits but we believe that they will be fairly un noticeable due to hugely improved noise management plan and execution Feel free to contact directly if you want to discuss in more detail,negative

Hi could not find ur reply,negative
Mohan great to see your garden and experiences developing a rich fully organic fruit and vegetable patch in a small area When I used to live in bangalore I thought it would be a good idea for someone to take over small gardens of apartments and plant fruits and vegetable plants for a monthly service fee instead of fancy lawns Would be great if you could hire some local gardeners and offer such a service to small plot owners and apartments,positive
Hi  first lets understand mealy bugs mealy bugs are sticky white coloured creatures  easy to identify,negative
But always a hint lies with Ants yes  Ants feed on the honeydew when you find ants crawling around your plants indoors or out or observed making a nice trail from a plant,positive
Take some time to examine your houseplants closely for these sucking pests,negative
In most cases natural predators provide enough control for mealybugs keeping the population at levels too low to cause lasting damage to your plants But mealybug populations may surge if enough natural predators dont visit your yard,negative
Parasitic wasps are the main mealybug predators There are many types of parasitic wasps all of which you can attract with the right plants like marigold  rosemary etc,positive
If the mealy bugs are more  jet spray with water as much as possible  you can also  buy neem oil dilute it with water and spray on the mealy bug affected part  first spray on a small area and then check if it affects the plant   if the infestation is really high  you can cut that part and dispose it far  before it spreads to other plants,negative
Use neem oil  in moderation esp It has to be diluted  and you will slowly see the results,negative
Forgot to add  Control the Ants  as they are the ones that protect mealy bugs,negative
If you could kindly share ur learningslinksbook info if any that we can study too do let us know,negative
Fascinating to see what grows in such a different climate from mine Its all beautiful,positive

Thank you for sharing I am really inspired,positive
Spraying ash on sapling helps  Then I used compost and well dried manure to reduce insects,negative
Growing some insect repellent plants also helps,positive
More over I realised insect must have their share too Tried  to cultivate some good will for them and throwing them away instead of killing them will help too I guess they understand,negative
Great job done by you,positive

organic food becomes expensive for 3 reasons 1 lack of mass market 2 prone to more wastage compared to chemical farming 3 involves lot of trialanderror as there is no Package of PracticePoP for  organic farming,negative
I think demand is actually high for organic food Unless cultivated on a large scale that cannot be met and mass marketed and wastage I did not get that Crop waste can go as fodder or dried up and used as dry flower bouquets and potpourri stuff For the third one fortunately many ppl are awakening in realising the essence of natural food and air,positive
I too hope will start giving back to nature,positive
If you want the best grow the best,positive
Indeed a great work Congratulations,positive

Too bad the big guys are squeezing the life out of the farmers to make a buck while the senior management make all the profits and fat bonuses Theyve been there a few years make the money and runThey then use tax payers money for farmers and their families to provide support and counselling services as they send them to the wall And they cry farmers need to be innovative Aussies farmers getting screwed again Think they could trim some of their fat wages and have better and more ethical management farmers could just get on with the job being legends What a timely parody for these guys trying to look good,negative

As farmers we manage our land our livestockcropsmachinery and our people work assets we manage our daily accounting our forecasts and our cash flow We are the customers of the banks  In general  our skillsets are greater than those who lend us money to conduct our businesses  lets be proud of this  Lets make the consumers aware and proud of what we do and acknowledge our skill sets   we have allowed a disconnect between us and them and they frequently comment that we choose to do what we do and then whinge when things go wrong Lets mend this disconnect  we may thing they are demanding etc and on the wrong track but they do buy our produce Lets keep our capmpaigns truthful and positive Our customers can also often be other big businesses WooliesColes etc who are out to keep their shareholders happy like the banks  they want a profit  but so do we  we can only win by working together  and this also means leaving our disgruntlement with farm bodies eg NFF at the farm gate The world is a cut throat place so lets work together and be seen with those who are trying to improve our lot and there are many  lets give out a positive united vibe  we are the best  lets help each other stay the best  and yes well fall in a heap now and then  but lets work at picking ourselves up before we fall if we can  Lets be aware and active in whats going on out there  keep the complacent dog at bay,positive

This is the best commercial ever I imagine this is exactly how it would go if you asked a bunch of suits to run a farm The average consumer has no idea the work involved in a day in our  shoes Well done,positive
Until you have spent actual time farming and raising livestock you have no more right to accuse farmers in general of cruelty than we do of you for having a cat or dog I will agree there are a few bad apples amongst farmers and pet owners Please do not assume because you saw one news article about a lazy farmer not tending his animals that we are all the same nor will I believe that because I saw a news article about dog fighting that my neighbor is secretly running a chihuahua fight club in his basement,negative
Jackie Fuller I believe the difference is a dairy is twice a day every day EVERY DAY  365 weekends birthdays Easter Christmas No vacation no sick days And when they arent milking they are feeding birthing scraping poop I know everyone works hard in every job done its just that as you stroll thru the grocery store buying what you need please remember a lot of very hard working farmers choose to spend every day working beside their families in a barn to provide America those groceries and its a very thankless job,positive

It isnt just Monsanto Its almost every Democrat and Republican in power How else could police go after young mothers protecting their kids from vaccines or chemotherapy Yet Monsanto goes around terrorizing other farmer trespassing into their property and creating a monopoly in the food industry Congress could have taken action long ago and instead they stay quiet because they really support Monsanto and think the alternative doctors and young mothers are misguided people who need the government to tell you everything to do,negative
They shouldnt be grown at all,negative
Even if they just take the subsidies away from GMO corn I think they would go out of business,negative
Drug companies make huge profits from all of this Also now that so many people have realized that Big Pharma is great in emergencies but for health care its terrible they pass the affordable care act to force everybody to buy from big Pharma Even if you decide not to get insurance you will still pay a fee to pay for other peoples insurance which only covers stuff like drugs and surgery,negative
Its not complety truein FRance for instance glyphosate is still allowed for the next 3 or 4 years,negative

Now thats what Im fighting for,positive

Kudos to The Philippines   one of the most recent countries  in banning Monsanto from their country Jamaica lets go for it emotions among many of our people would change for the better Remember we are what we eat all of us,negative
Too bad North America is too stupid to ban them,negative
Mike Althouse it figures that the US is the biggest grower Uhhhgggg,positive
Glysophate causes cancer thats why theres class action lawsuits for farm workers happening now Glysophate ruins the soil and ground water thats not sustainable Glysophate causes weeds and pests to adapt becoming resistant to the amounts of the poison used in turn more of said poison must be used to combat the resistance Not sustainable Also your thought process is flawed and uninformed at best also not sustainable Cheers,negative
Organic produce has become increasingly popular in recent years as consumers have grown more health conscious and environmentally aware Many stores and supermarkets now have large sections devoted to organic fruits and vegetables,positive
Contrary to what most people believe organic does not automatically mean pesticidefree or chemicalfree In fact under the laws of most states organic farmers are allowed to use a wide variety of chemical sprays and powders on their crops,negative
So what does organic mean It means that these pesticides if used must be derived from natural sources not synthetically manufactured Also these pesticides must be applied using equipment that has not been used to apply any synthetic materials for the past three years and the land being planted cannot have been treated with synthetic materials for that period either,negative
Most organic farmers and even some conventional farmers too employ mechanical and cultural tools to help control pests These include insect traps careful crop selection there are a growing number of diseaseresistant varieties and biological controls such as predator insects and beneficial microorganisms,negative
ORGANIC PRODUCE AND PERSONAL HEALTH,positive
When you test synthetic chemicals for their ability to cause cancer you find that about half of them are carcinogenic,negative
Until recently nobody bothered to look at natural chemicals such as organic pesticides because it was assumed that they posed little risk But when the studies were done the results were somewhat shocking you find that about half of the natural chemicals studied are carcinogenic as well,negative
This is a case where everyone consumers farmers researchers made the same dangerous mistake We assumed that natural chemicals were automatically better and safer than synthetic materials and we were wrong Its important that we be more prudent in our acceptance of natural as being innocuous and harmless,negative
ORGANIC PESTICIDES VERSUS SYNTHETIC PESTICIDES,positive
Clearly the less we impact our environment the better off we all are Organic farming practices have greatly advanced the use of nonchemical means to control pests as mentioned earlier,positive
Unfortunately these nonchemical methods do not always provide enough protection and its necessary to use chemical pesticides How do organic pesticides compare with conventional pesticides,negative
A recent study compared the effectiveness of a rotenonepyrethrin mixture versus a synthetic pesticide imidan Rotenone and pyrethrin are two common organic pesticides imidan is considered a soft synthetic pesticide ie designed to have a brief lifetime after application and other traits that minimize unwanted effects It was found that up to 7 applications of the rotenone pyrethrin mixture were required to obtain the level of protection provided by 2 applications of imidan,negative
It seems unlikely that 7 applications of rotenone and pyrethrin are really better for the environment than 2 applications of imidan especially when rotenone is extremely toxic to fish and other aquatic life,negative
It should be noted however that we dont know for certain which system is more harmful This is because we do not look at organic pesticides the same way that we look at conventional pesticides We dont know how long these organic pesticides persist in the environment or the full extent of their effects,negative
When you look at lists of pesticides allowed in organic agriculture you find warnings such as Use with caution The toxicological effects of organic pesticide X are largely unknown or Its persistence in the soil is unknown Again researchers havent bothered to study the effects of organic pesticides because it is assumed that natural chemicals are automatically safe,negative
WHY HAVENT WE HEARD THIS BEFORE,negative
For obvious reasons organic farmers have done little if anything to dispel the myth that organic  chemicalpesticidefree They would only stand to lose business by making such a disclosure,negative
Pesticide manufacturers have little concern in the matter To them synthetic pesticides sold and organic pesticides sold are both pesticides sold,negative
As for conventional farmers they are not really in a position to be critical It would not be in their interest to draw attention to chemical and pesticide use,negative
WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN,negative
The purpose in writing this article is not to discourage you from buying organic produce,positive
It is only meant to let you know what you are or arent getting when you make such a purchase Unless you know your grower personally there is no guarantee that your produce has been grown without pesticides or other chemicals Its a point to consider given the substantially higher cost of organic foods,negative
There are many choices and decisions that we as consumers are asked to make Hopefully this has provided some new information that you will find helpful,positive

Copy and pasting trolls dont change reality,negative
This is from A Mercola sponsored website Thats why I copy  paste To say organic pesticides are healthier or superior to synthetics is false  not backed by peerreviewed science I suppose you believe the Earth is flat  climate change is a hoax Google search Mercola science turns out he prefers pseudoscience Especially when he tried to sell healthy tanning beds,negative
Their goal is to ultimately bankrupt all farmers at the time of their choosing then BUY ALL OF THOSE FARMS  control the ENTIRE food supply These things are not a secret The Trilateral Commission has very clear cut strategies  goals They have been available to be read for over 40 years Hopefully we are not too late to make a difference,negative

I hope America wakes up and banns GMO products,negative
Good vs evil Good is winning Yeheyyy,positive
Austin P Fink Youre a real piece of work arent you I hear Big Ag is paying people to do exactly what youre doing right now You should look into getting paid if youre not already The reality is that changing the genetics of a plant affects how it interacts with the microbiome of the soil which is critical But lets be honest if youre growing GMO crops you have no clue what a microbiome is for if you did youd never spray Roundup again Do you know what the pesticide my friend uses in his garden consists of Tobacco cayenne garlic apple cider vinegar Id drink that More than you can say for synthetic oil derived corporate fake food,negative
We lost control of the wheel a few decades back the ones of us paying attention are just as shocked as everyone else,negative
Always money driving these horrible decisions  We need to boycott these products Hitting them in the wallet is the only way to make things change,negative
Sadly the area where Ive lived for the past 30 years has agreed to have Monsanto build a facility larger than life just to take over the farmers in the largest region of cotton growers in the US I saw the entire process happen This IS real folks So Very Real,positive
Because we the taxpayers subsidize GMO grains grown in this country they are able to export to Europe China and the world cheaper than they can grow conventional grains,positive

My brother fought along with many others   To try and stop Monsanto from using a huge acreage on the Gippsland highway between Trafalgar  and the city  Of course to no avail     At the time he stockpiled huge amount of assorted seed  from Tasmania where at that time banned genetically engineering of vegetation  My brother did this because he found he couldnt dry  his own tomatoes that he was once able to bought from super market    Because they would not grow,negative
Not sorry at all delighted to hear it and stick it to those,positive

When you grow up on a farm every farm kid wants to drive the tractor Thats the cool thing to do What I learned is that some days you drive the tractor and some days you scoop hog manure Thats work balance Throughout my career I have been able to take the bad with the good said Jeff Raikes in a recent interview Food for thought,positive
Whilst some things take generations to resolve I have no doubt we are well on our way We are already seeing dramatic increases in food production throughout the continent as our farmers are increasingly getting support  Its a generational fight you must finish We need some of you who started on the farm like Jeff Raikes to remember where you started and go back to build modern farms,positive
When I visited Jeff Raikes remarkable farm one of the thoughts that came to my mind was this Imagine what would happen if all of us who started out on the farm were to go back with our modern ideas and radically change agriculture like Jeff and his late brother did,positive
I know someone will quickly say to me that their rural family farm of two acres is too small for anything You should see what the Dutch and the Israelis do with just two acres  You can do anything if you allow your imagination to take a hold of the possibilities,negative
We must feel ashamed when we allow our grandmothers mothers and sisters or anyone at all to work the land with that ancient tool called a hoe I want to see the hoe become a museum relic during my life time Will you join this fight,negative
Agriculture probably offers the greatest opportunities of any industry even today Dont just look at it in terms of ploughing a field and growing something Look at it as a business and a vast industry that can absorb any type of skill When we visited Stanford we met young tech entrepreneurs who are working with satellites and big data from California to predict agriculture production in any African village without ever going there Its like Google Maps from space Soon if someone claims to have produced food when instead they pocketed the money these guys will be able to tell you,positive
One of my fastestgrowing businesses uses mobile phones to supply microinsurance to farmers We are making good money I tell you Its time for you to look at your business or career in the city and ask yourself what am I doing in agriculture,positive
We have to end this concept which some people have which is that a farm is a place to retire at the end of your career I hear so many people say When I retire as a civil servant I will go back to the village and become a farmer   Im sorry but that is the wrong mindset If you have a burning passion for agriculture go there now at the height of your strength   And if you think there is no money in it then I guess you are admitting youre not an entrepreneur,negative

I do marketing for the company currently in Lesotho and Uganda and the hardest part of my job is making people trust our product Our product is built with highquality durable materials and as a life expectancy of 812 years but it is very difficult to convince locals to trust and invest in it They have had so many cheap cookstoves and other products brought from China which broke down quickly and never delivered on their promise that now they are weary to trust any new business claiming to solve their energy problems,negative
I understand their frustrations it makes me very mad to think that they were taken advantage of in the past But also I want to show them that we have the best intentions and all we want to do is empower them to lead a better life I really believe in our product but I am having troubles making others believe in it as well How would you approach this problem Your advice would really mean a lot thank you,negative

When its comes to businesses it is always a big problems for most of the  entrepreneurs and farmers in Africa Apart from using local tools for farming which makes them using a lot of time and energy and end up harvesting very little than what they have invested it is also very hard to find a good markets for their crops  And the number one biggest problem for their crops are our own african governments  I am not blaming them but what iam real talking here  most of  them they are only there for farmers during the harvest time and think theyre helping them by telling them not sale their crops for this time or that time  or where to sale instead of helping them from the beginning,negative
Karibu Sana Daktari Mungu akubariki,negative

Apparently I see much efforts of most African leaders trying their level best to strive this tragedy of Hunger Examples have been displayed already But I urge that governments and private sectors from developed countries should invest more in agriculture sector in Africa by employing more technologies build infrastructures and industries to make agriculture live to save many lives We expect to be having more hunger next year but we are still reluctant Let those who are educated teach us on how to fish than giving us food What will our future generation eat if we depend on AIDS We should know how to fish for future,negative

Pressing concerns for proper Green Revolution Africas agricultural and agribusiness limitations are many and include both the way goods  are grown and the way value is added In a report released by the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience at AGRF 2017 the fall armyworm  a large worm that spreads rapidly and destroys crops  has now invested 28 African countries The worm feeds on more than 80 crops and cut yields by up to 60  raising a substantial threat to agriculture output CABI estimates that the finacial cost of the work in just 10 of Africas mIss prouducing countries  could be as high as 55 bn a year Although many farmers are starting to use new technologies to counter environmental concerns such as disease resistant seed strains environmentally friendly pesticides and improved irrigation yields remain signicantly under their potential Finance is also a sizeable barrier to the uprising of small holder farms as financial institutions rarely find agricultural projects bankable in Africa As an alternative to banks more innovative methods of financing smallhopdings are beginog to emmerge especially with the abiquity I the smartphone and the greater Connectivity of farms Urbanisation and an ageing farmer population are also a concern causing a quickly depleting workforce Finally many raw commodities are being exported across the world and much of their potential value gets lost in the process,negative

absolutelythough its a long way to achieve that but i believe we can by uniting small holder farmersand this will help them start by owning tractors and other agriculture machines as communityand these machines will perform their work as a group and individually as they see it fitBut first thing first the best way to make the hoe become a museum is by uniting farmers after managing to unite them then is where we can make a step in agriculture,positive

Good idea AGRA But but the implementation bit Workshops Workshops I call them talkshops typical of the NGO world majority of whom I refer as merchants of poverty The smallholder farmer is the face of philanthropy their poverty evokes emotions and loosens the wallets of the donors In the end 98 of the monies end up in the wallets of the socalled consultants expensive hotels fuel guzzling 4x4s flights and the smallholder farmer continues getting poorer of course the poverty will attract more donor money and the circus continues Any food secure country Strive Masiyiwa has not been fed by smallscale farming As long as you still sell the poor farmer as the panacea of Africas food security youre chasing a mirage,negative

Agriculture is key to economic development Besides food security the industry is labour intensive hence the ability to provide employment to most of our youths skilled semi skilled  none skilled Even then on its own agriculture cannot thrive without coopting enabler support sectors like industrialisation  technology innovation in order to achieve value addition of finished products Hence its imperative for African leaders to abreast themselves on much wider consultations if fruitful results can be realised from agriculture Moreover a much broad approach must be laid ahead since the sector is wide beef dairy hides horticulture fruits  a lot much more cash crops such as soya beans tobacco corn maize burley tobacco etc,positive

Indeed youre right sir and Im joining the fight Even the lands that our fellow Africans till with that ancient hoe are larger in size than the lands tilled with more advanced farming implements used in developed countries I believe our mindset has to keep changing to realise that not only large scale and medium scale commercial farmers in Africa can utilise and manage these implements but also small holder communal farmers Id love to see the Tractor and cultivator working the land rather than the laborious hoe to even make farming more efficient and enjoyable for the youths in communal areas I believe this will even reduce the massive ruralurban migration happening in some African countries,positive

As a family farmer who eats meat I can say without a doubt all livestock species need space and grass and sun and living in herdsflocks  Transport to slaughter is incredibly stressful  The best model Ive seen is bringing module abattoirs to the farm itself  To ignore the quality of life for animals and efficient death is not necessary  its only to keep the job easy and prices down  If you care about animals and eat meat find a local farmer and know their practices,negative

Working on passing a lift of the ban on backyard chickens as well in my town Taking care of animals is an important part of understanding your impact on quality of life of those you buy  not to mention less expensive food and better quality over all  I want these laws  as an organic farmer  But it has to be both,positive
Trolls trolls trolls  Love my President,positive
It just gets worse every day For all of us and all the animals Tillersonget him out of thereNOW,negative
You cant impeach a president just because you dont like him If that were possible Obama would have been ousted too Do you really think Hiliary would have upheld these laws Please she had her own agenda as well Not all farmers abuse their animals Most organic farmers already treat their animals with the utmost kindness Factory farms are notorious for their cruelty Know your local farmers and choose local sources Not all Republicans and rightwingers are evil and greedy Demonizing human beings that do not share your world view will only encourage violence against them and since nobody is willing to compromise there will be volatile retaliation in an increasingly vicious circle Politicians work for all of us and there will always be times when they are pushing more to support their own personal agendas over others People got tired of ultraprogressive Liberals telling them how to live their lives and Hiliary was threatening more of the same If Trump can be impeached just because people dont like him then be prepared for that consequence with any future president that you might support,negative
I love the way people are blaming this on Trump when its the greed of the organic producers The consumer can control this with their wallets Do your research Only buy from those who still follow the original guidelines,positive
more proof they dont really care about what the majority of the public wantsso many examples of this  disturbing,negative
Thank you for caring for your animals in a humane and loving wayWe support and celebrate traditional farmers and ranchers who have humane standards for the sake of animals the land and local communities We would love for you to read about our rural development and outreach program and also our state agriculture councils,positive
Do you people honestly believe that anyone of either party runs the government in such a way that it truly benefits anyone other than themselves  I always look for independent organic certification on organic products I purchaseUSDA is really meaningless to me I think the government messes up everything they touch so they have zero credibilityDemocrat or Republican does not matter,negative
The Humane Society of the United States  I definitely follow you and other groups  Just signed up to be on our local agricultural board as we are rezoning this year and looking to establish an agricultural zone around our downtown area  Working through storm Skylar right now but count myself fortunate with only one branch on the fence line today,positive
Abuse of any animal should not be allowed,negative
This is very misleading  Being organic needs more than the farmer saying so  Lots of farmers that claimed to be organic actually were notthey charged more if it says organicso now it has to be redone to be fair to all farmersif you are organic you are now going to have to prove it not just claim you are  I think that is a good idea,negative

Well I believe that our administration is doing a better job than our past administrations as to bringing our country back to the way it used to be  In my opinion though people have just gotten more and more liberal with everything which I really think is making a lot of the population a more angry group than ever before  God bless America  We really need it,positive

Get with what this post is about  Not politics that you seem to know nothing about,negative
The Trump administration is destroying America All the programs many good and honest people crafted and worked for are being tossed out the window in favor of third world lobby efforts Its all for big business folks they are pushing all the family farmers out and soon the big conglomerates will be State Run Just like Russia Korea China just pick any dictator and this is all in the planbook,negative
The Dept of Agriculture is a sham Im seeing evidence of that here in Chicago,negative
Isnt there anything that we post on fb that doesnt turn political  It is very disheartening that it always turns to our President  The people of this nation chose him and those that voted for him need to be respected just as you would want to be respected,negative

Yeah and what about all the illegals that rape and murder US citizens Thats ok for democrats to allow this  Ur sick,negative
We can still do something about this  we can just stop eating them,negative

I have stopped eating meat since I watched a documentary on 60 minutes showing how the livestock was being mistreated and even sick cows were being dragged into the slaughter house you could see the look of terror in their eyes,negative
Most evil administration along with Hitler,negative
Sorry but this country sucks I only eat organic and grass fed and I had hoped the standard would be raised for all livestock All animals deserve humane treatment regardless if they are being raised for food or whatever,negative
Thank you Pamela Paquin If it wasnt for family farmers like you I would starve,positive
I have absolutely come to despise this current administration and those who work under him  My heart aches for the destruction they are wielding to practices across the board,negative

No surprise though under our current administration,negative
Chiara M Chiara and consumers like you  I only feed myself and my neighbors and friends and always wish I could do more  but for now as the 4th generation of farmers I can contribute locally  I used to love bringing kids to my farm for educational trips  tracking droughts walking in the woods without lights at night and learning not to be afraid experiencing how to meet an animal where its at instead of forcing yourself into it while its held  and just where meat comes from  When I retire I really look forward to going back to that  stay safe if youre in the storm today,positive
The sad part is I dont think it would matter to him  He is just the devil in a suit,negative

Yes our republic is at stake and that is why I am totally with the President who was put in place by the people who put him in office  I dont always like the way he speaks but he has done more good for our country and in a short time than any president I have seen in my lifetime  I see the evil in peoples hearts all around because their person didnt win  I saw our country almost being lost by our last president  And now our country is finally coming back to what it was years ago when we had a good economy a military to protect us from rogue nations being replenished and back to a God fearing nation I hope  There are so many people that are so mean to others because their beliefs are different  We are a country with a lot of different views on things but the hate I see in this country for its people disgust me  We should all respect the office of the Presidency and for our flag which a lot of people died for that flag which symbolizes the freedom we all have because of those people who gave their lives for it,positive
Jaime Goich Haha shame on you  I am crying now,negative
By the way I dont mean to go back to the 1950s  I sent that comment because I get sick and tired of so many people making things political all the time  I love animals a lot more than a lot of people to tell you the truth  If it is absolutely true that our President took a stand for cruelty of animals in any way I am against that policy  I just hate people making everything on fb a political forum,negative

Ruth Francis dont tell me what I need to do I know you think you are God but you are not The sad part is you are no different then the people you call hateful You are a bitter woman what would really change the treatment of all animals is a heart change in people People being kind to each other something you dont seem to be able to do  How sad is it that we need laws to tell us to be kind to animals or each other Why is that  Because people like you call names and spread hate  Writing to the administration Starting a fund doing other things may get a second look Or rallying other animal lovers to stop buying  food in stores Go to humane farmers Order on line  But your answer is to attack  And thats why people have lost the ability to love each other and animals Look in the mirror and thank yourself and what you teach each time an animal is abused,negative
This is shamefull and dangereous for consumers to abandon basic animal welfare standards Sick malnurished and mistreted animals who do not eat right and are sick or injured are not only inhumane but allow for animal abuse as well Animals should be raised according to their natural needswithout pain and suffering I dont want to swallow animal suffering in my food,negative

Ok  Good now that that is settled and you understand life would not exist without things that eat meat lets get to your main point if you love animals you dont wanna them  I agree I do t eat the animals I love  But  the aggressive ones I have no problem eating them And if youre a farmer if you live with herds and flicks you know there are always the ones that must go  Im not here to change your mind if your vegetarian and I really appreciate everyone that cares enough not to engage in mindless consumption  of animals or plants or any thing on earth  But for those who do eat meat  I hope they do it with as much kindness and consideration as possible  I was quite clear by making this statement I would receive comments like this here on this page  But my suggestion to you is when people you disagree with are offering to talk and take into consideration the welfare of animals as they live and die  not to attack them but to be grateful theyre trying and work to make more farmers like that  with 10 billion animals a year dying for our food  its super important we progress  Because the vast majority are not afforded grass and air and living in herds and most are transported for slaughter  So when farmers are trying to make that system better its not a good idea to attack them Youll slow down progress,neutral
Bryana Merchant how do you justify working at Target where meat of the lowest quality is sold and having your opinion You represent and support their business by taking their money  Dont get me wrong everyone is a hypocrite in one way or another  but thats the point stones in glass houses and all that,negative
Trudy Der Kinderen there are many more  part of what makes it hard for farmers to choose practices are rules about no slaughter on farms for food safety reasons taxes on land that make it hard to have enough pasture to graze  Ive never fully understood why male calves are killed as babies for veal  but of course if we want the milk the calves cant take it  such large scale systems are really messy  Almond and Soy milk are terrible for the environment  but there is a brand called Oatly from oats that is much less damaging and a new and great option  We all just have to keep going,negative

Dont let them get you down  There are some people in this world that thrive on hatred as you have witnessed on here  Its a real shame that they have to sink this far to get their point across  At least domesticated animals love unconditionally so maybe they can learn a lesson from these innocent creatures,negative

Kathy Compagno Im not sure people want it I think in many cases they just are not aware or thinking about it Some dont feel they can afford or get access to a better choice  I get that  and applaud farmers and organizations trying to do a better job of reaching out and working together to make changes  Every little bit helps,neutral
I dont think this is the greed of organic producers I rather suspect that nonorganic producers now see the demand for organic and want to get in on it but not with all the restrictions It is they who probably lobbied for thisand won because they are well big corporations,negative

Besides the importance of this litigation for helping animals who are being abused it is also very important because I think it is dangerous that the courts are deciding that the USA citizens dont have any right to see documentation  We pay for the salaries of the USDA employeesyes we do have a right  Thank you ALDF for pursuing this on behalf of beleaguered animals,positive

The USDA should retain full oversight authority over all inspections of puppy mills roadside zoos and research facilities The USDA should not view thirdparty inspections and certifications favorably when determining the frequency of federal inspections that may be needed This type of industry selfpolicing reduces transparency and accountability and has already proven to fail,negative

Bad idea USDA Protect all animals,negative

Do they have to screw up everything,negative
We should regulate the all inspections of puppy mills roadside zoos and research Faclilites We are going backward instead of fareward if we dont,negative
What are these boneheads thinking Havent they done enough damage unraveling everything the animal advocate groups have done to protect the welfare of our wildlife,negative
These animals need full protection The USDA needs to keep control to make sure they are protected from abuse,negative

HSUS provide some talking points   The link is to FEDERAL comments  If you want us to help provide us with the data   Otherwise a comment can be a bit too simple like mine  Do NOT outsource Animal Welfare Act inspections to private entities or third parties  This outsourcing would allowing various animal use industries to police themselves and the reason the regulation exists is because these entities do NOT police themselves   Outsourcing Animal Welfare Act inspections which is a duty of the government under law would be harmful indeed disastrous for the welfare of animals kept in puppy mills roadside zoos research facilities and animalrelated events eg horse shows and rodeos   Please do not outsource these inspections,negative
Sadly there is already little done about puppy mills but this would be worse,negative

Before all the Zinke haters pile on this discussion please educate yourselves at a minimum to know that the USFS reports through the Department of Agriculture with Sonny Perdue as its secretary,negative

Utahs Bureau of Land Management is preparing for a possible rush of mining claims in the area opened up by Trumps decision to reduce the size of the Bears Ears and Grand StaircaseEscalante National Monuments Millions of acres of land will soon be open for mining claims governed by an 1872 law describing the process for prospecting and staking claims in the western United States Once the decision goes into effect on Feb 2 the area will be subject to gold silver copper and uranium mining claims,negative
This is not what the tribes recommend,negative
The hair doesnt have to be splitZinke as head of the DOI manages 507 million acres among them hundreds of dams reservoirs over 400 National Parks monuments seashore areas and national wildlife refuges  If the US Forestry Service doesnt set foot on any of these where are THEIR 154 national forests 20 national grasslands and 222 research and experimental forests that encompass 192 million acres of public land  Just curious,negative
Thats what the Ojibwe said about the North Woods,positive
If you think distinctions between grazing oil  gas timber mining watershed power generation recreation  natural preservation activities on public land is splitting hairs then I guess youre right,negative
If youre genuinely curious about land ownership  management distinctions and there are many here is a map where you can get started  To truly understand  you should know the roles each agency plays in resource management,positive

And zero thanks to Zinke for his efforts to undermine protected landsGlad you guys dont have to report to him like the poor DOI folks,negative
William Stronk If Im a tool make mine a hammer,negative
William I understand how you feel but I dont think Im wasting my breath encouraging people understand how public land is allocated and managed,negative
Granted there are many who dont want to understand the roles and responsibilities of BLM or USFS  It is indeed very complicated  There are fewer still that want to become involved through public commenting processes  It seems many just want to consume a steady diet of environmentalist BS so they can post  Zinke must go over  over while not having a clue as to what his job entails,negative
But I have had conversations with a couple people who are willing to learn about these agencies and not just swallow the easy leftist media crap then spit it back out everytime the DOI posts scenery,negative
So Im a little encouraged here and there,positive
My disclaimer is that I am far from an expert in public land management the more I learn the less I seem to know  But I do  deal with some of this as part of my job,positive
Good to hear Alex  Unfortunately there are some Ive seen responding negatively to DOI pictures who dont know the difference between national forests national parks and national monuments,negative
Can I get a copy of that list Just want to keep track in the future,negative

Are you serious Zinkes from California has a house in Whitefish MT Hed sell his mother if he could make a buck,negative
I was thinking of applying just to keep mining out,negative
Then one of the first things you should hear Jim Brewer is that you should not try to impose your viewpoint about what it is that others want to know or consume  By doing so you underestimate your fellow citizens  Granted few people take the time to understand the distinctions of Fed hierarchy  as evidenced by the comment about the Foerstry Service  You should know however that despite the fact that the US Forest Service is administered under the Dept of Ag its budget is still a part of the Dept of Interiors allocation  Thereby their policy is influenced by priorities set by Congress for the Dept of Interior  When you presume that the public is naive or uneducated  listening only to a steady diet of environmentalist BS you disrespect your fellow American by assuming that its beyond their understanding  Truth is what it comes down to is the constant state of inconsistency in resource organizations despite the lifelong dedication of most of their employees One cannot be held resonsible for the health  welfare of their patch if policies  priorities change yearly or wdifferent administrations  Especially when dealing with resources that range from a 40yr lifecycle eg trees to an irreplaceable resource like oil or copper  So quit calling it easy leftist crap until youve learned more  please,negative
I will join you Lynne,positive
Stop the corporate profit madness already,negative
Gloria Robbins   Ill start here  you said You should know however that despite the fact that the US Forest Service is administered under the Dept of Ag its budget is still a part of the Dept of Interiors allocation,negative
It took me 15 seconds on Wikipedia to find out thats not true,negative
You then admonish me for presuming the public is naive or uneducated and excoriate me until Ive learned more,negative
Look I dont underestimate anybody and although I might be caustic in my responses to zinke nazi posts I will always offer to help anybody learn more about how public land organizations work  usually because when Im challenged Ill go learn more too,positive
But in much less time it took for you to lambaste someone youve never met on a public forum you could have looked at the reference here to know that Bob was wrong,negative
I guess Im coming around to William Stronks viewpoint,positive
Forest Service is still allowed to talk about climate change  Why arent you US Department of the Interior,negative

fair point Luke indeed your right these mechanized practices allow us to farm much larger areas more efficiently than before But then you have to be able to fertilize and keep that large area of crop safe from pests etc using a reduced workforce hence the mass use of chemical fertilizer  insecticide which runs into the streams and messes up all the wildlife etc but that is a different argument You do have to wonder what happened to all those farm workers though Farming used to be a way of life a large community  from my own limited perspective in the UK ive seen it dwindle away since just the 1980s  many rural villages are now second homes for wealthy londoners due to the lack of work available,negative

Adam David Gilardi I live in a country that has been voted most innovative country for several years in a row now What that means tangibly is that our local post office is now closed and replaced by a machine in the local supermarket where btw many people are now replaced by automated scanning  payment system The local Bank has also replaced the employees with new machines where you can also deposit now Zrich Airport dont have many Check in counters anymore one lady admins 30 check in machines now Unemployment creates massive social problems crime and opioid epidemics are only a few  symptoms the chauffeurs are the next to be replaced and this only the tip of the iceberg So its not about outsourcing its about replacement,negative

Joshua you are very wrong not all of it is automative So much is needed from people i grew up in the imperial valley number 1 agriculture county an let me tell you i can name you all the jobs this machine can replace but can it keep up Fast pace the time the hours Most of these fields need to be picked by hand even when machines are there they are the ones putting them on rails like for the melon an other stuff,positive

eventually i guess well if AI is ever advanced  reliable enough to carry out complex repairs maintainance etc then we will indeed be living in a very different world Im not sure how far off that is but there is definetly a push in that direction Whats your stance here  that automation should be moderated  stopped  what kind of solution or alternative would you propose Frankie,negative

Michael Studiomtn Nguyen that is a false statement that the old jobs will be replaced by the same number of new jobs Even if that was true then whats the point There will be no motivation because the net effect is no increase in efficiency Efficiency means less jobs As we increase our efficiency the shift to new industry creates even fewer jobs than it destroyed Eg at JPMorgan their COIN project just takes seconds to process contracts that takes 360000 lawyer hours to complete,negative

read some history Bo  Party philosophy changed greatly during the 20s 30s 40s etc and by the 1960s and the Civil Rights movement the Southern Democrats left the party to join the Republicans  their stance changed to what it is now  Originally the Dems in the 1850s had the hell bent GOP philosophy but now the Republicans have completely changed their philosophy  Lincoln would never be a Republican now  In theory the Dems you talk about with the KKK were the Republicans since the parties changed  Look at Trumps father who was part of that fine organization,negative

Joanna Smith actually he had more in his war chest in 2016 and he lost Hillary raised more than he did but she donated one third of it to down ticket Democratic candidates and she donated one third of it to the Democratic Party Bernie refused to support down ticket Democratic candidates One of the many reasons why we democrats rejected Bernie in 2016 We will do it again in 2020 BTW Prove your claim that he has millions in his war chest That will be difficult for you to do because he refuses to say how he spent his campaign donations We know that he spent 600000 of those donations to charter a private jet for him and his entourage to fly to the Vatican What a waste of donations Unethical I will be waiting for your evidence to prove how much he has in his war chest Dont fail on this I really want to see your proof,negative
Elizabeth Ann give it a break  I supported Bernie financially too but he will not win  He will not be running as a Democrat as he changed back to an Indie  There is no way that Biden or young Kennedy wont get the nod to run given they have given their lives for the party for decades  Bernie will not beat either one of them  Its time to understand for all of us that if Bernie divides the vote runs as an Indie he will get nowhere  Bernie lost to Clinton by almost 4 million votes and he would not have beaten the red states who have more voting power nor would he have changed the russian interference,negative

Bernie you arent even Blue talk about the ultimate sell out Why dont you make it official and join the democrats party The party whose leaders would shut the government down to not work on immigration Debate the 4 pillar plan which is a guarantee  of an additional 1 million people 45 proposed as a path to citizenship You would put the Democratic Party over a 18 people who as kids were brought to this country Why because their parents thought it was worth the risk for their childrens future How dare you talk red and blue when you should go one on one with President Trump and work out the deal Thats what leaders do not play politics Im ashamed on how you melted into the establishment Coward,negative

Dems will not win Texas and America doesnt need Texas to turn blue This is the problem with Democrats is that they have this mob gang mentality that everyone needs to think exactly like them and the world would be a better place because they are so much more morally pure than other parties The facts are you guys neglect everyday Americans and pigeon hole yourselves with small groups ie illegal immigrants LGBTQ and push these peoples concernsrights ahead of common Americans,negative
The constant hammering of the top 1 is earning too much as well Are we not all striving for our families to make the most money as possible Most households that make up this magical top 1 Im not talking Coca Cola or Walmart help there families which comes from their pockets So maybe stop using this scapegoat of the top 1 as the evil thats causing this country to fall into this apocalyptic and maybe look into that your policies are no good,negative
Take this for surface value most Americans saw more money in their pay checks this year than during any other administration prior Is that a bad thing I would hope democrats would say no but I dont think that is the case,negative
why blue  why red  why not Green,negative
While I definitely want better candidates in the Dem party I agree with the purity thing I see way too many people who write off candidates completely because of that one time they took money from pharma or that one policy that isnt strictly liberal People need to compromise at least a tiny bit,negative

A democrat incumbent candidate in Illinios is antichoice antilgbt equality anti healthcare pro war in the pocket of Wall Street and votes with republicans a majority of the time  So stop demanding people dont care about the issues and vote label only  People lie about their labels all of the time and voters need to start looking at where candidates are on the issues and if they walk the talk  Fortunately he has a opponent named Marie Newman who is a real democrat but if people just listened to this and only care about label nonsense the republican who claims a d label would never be voted out  Issues matter and people need to pay attention,negative

Carolyn Proctor Anti American He Believes in open Borders and that Illegal Immigrants Should be allowed to Vote and receive Tax dollars without contributing AntiLife he believes in the MURDER of the Unborn From the Moment Of Conception The Zygote Has Different DNA from the Mother and therefore though For the first 38 weeks dependent upon is a Separate Life  Social Security when it began the Ratio was 1594 people paying in for each   recipient as of 2013 you have 28 Paying in for each recipient  Because Congress both Democrats and Republicans Have raided  Social Security for their Pet Projects and they havent raised the retirement age As far as RoadsSchools And first responders those are Paid for through Property Taxes,negative
Bo Burlison It was always more of a regional issue than a partisan onebasically the Southern Democrats who founded the KKK and fought for slavery did so because they were Southern not because they were Democrats,negative
Nearly everyone in the South was racist encompassing not just the Souths Democrats but also the Souths Whigs and the Souths KnowNothings The Whigs and KnowNothings were less well organized so they dissolved after the Civil War leaving only the Democrats around which the Southern racists could coalesce Otherwise the Souths Whigs could quite plausibly have taken up the mantle And throughout all this many of the Norths Democrats disagreed with and opposed the Souths Democrats on those racial issues,negative
You also see this dynamic in the congressional votes on the Civil Rights Act of 1964every Democrat who opposed it was from the South while every Democrat from the North supported it as did a few Southern Democrats Meanwhile every Southern Republican opposed it as did a few Northern Republicans So the only Republicans who supported it were from the North the only Northerners who opposed it were Republicans every Democrat who opposed it was from the South and the only Southerners who supported it were Democrats,negative
Well nearly everyone everywhere in the country back then was racist in some way despite the Emancipation Proclamation Lincoln still expressed some prejudiced remarks about AfricanAmericans but the Southerners tended to be more violently racist,negative

Rachel Mckinnon You surprise me Why would a young strong willed minority woman be opposed to Bernie Sanders who is a strong supporter of womans issues womens reproductive rights civil rights equal rights etc etc when Republicans care more about the rich and the powerful They are willing to let Americans die who are without health insurance just to give tax cut to the rich What do you think of Joy Reed and Nina Turner who is a key person in the progressive movement You dont know what you dont know but you can learn,positive

Charlie Marceau Their are a lot of unfortunate circumstances regarding Argentina And I am not going to write you a book on Argentina or Vermont I will say look an Germany and all of nothern Europe Unless you are extremely wealthy its hard to deny their high standard of living They have an excellant standard for the middle class When tarveling immerse yourself in other cultures experience different people and life styles and broaden your perspective on other cultures America has socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor and the struggling,negative

Por esto y ms es que no me gustan los restaurantes de cadena Apoya lo Local,negative
I have to give Applebees upOKIts too bad  I really liked thier food BUT  I will not eat at the above restaurants until they stop  serving us bad food  Is it that hard to go Organic I know all of these restaurants make good money but not at our expense  WE MUST DEMAND CLEAN FOOD,negative

Does Captain Avocado have the data to support his claims,negative
Theres no might be about Wolfe being a scam artist Hes 100 conman,negative
Kim Gilmore Vaccinating and drinking your own pee are both batshit crazy,negative
Per Bluhm Yet the page posts the meme from David Wolfe that is not reflected at all in the article Wolfe didnt even share the actual article that is linked in the post,negative

i would love to take you seriously but posting things from the SHAM david avocado wolfe isnt helping your case,negative
The post is from The Organic Consumers Association they shared from Eat Local Grown and the post explicitly states Via David Wolfe David Wolfe may be crazy but is definitely not responsible for content he shares from other sources,negative

Good thing I dont eat meat,negative
Actually Subway shouldnt be on the list,negative
What happened to home cooked meals I have returned to buying quality food and ingredients40 lb weight losspain freememory has improvedwrinkle freeat 60 You are what you eat,positive
Devon R Foster Why Especially since they are big industry chains I would expect them to follow the highest quality and safety standards How come they get a free pass to act in irresponsible and harmful manner Especially these big ones should be concerned about the immense impact they have on nature animals and humans In the end they are liable to laws and regulations as any other one and if people didnt retreat to low expectations but proactively increased pressure and communicatedasserted their desire to get good quality food in a more sustainable manner then maybe things would change But yes I am not eating at any of those places However many people do,negative
Agreed What is and what is not allowed vis a vis food  is one area where I think the EU can teach us something,negative
Im sure the US has standards and regulations too Additionally those companies are global players they are pretty much everywhere,positive
Remember Gujarat If McD didnt offer all those veg options there nobody would buy their shit,negative
All the gourmet restaurants now where do we go eat,positive

Faye Adams They were probably generalizing because they serve conventionally produced dairy products But the funny thing is even conventional milk has no antibiotics in it Its not allowed Its a stupid meme with no specifics or reliable source,negative
I would turn off the follow option but I like to keep tabs on the most crazy of people not west baptist church crazy but I am ok with this level of crazy,positive
Starbucks sells coffeeWTF but Im not defending them just curious,negative
Guess Im never eating out afain,negative
Faye Starbucks sells chicken salads wraps sandwiches with all different kinds of meats and cheeses egg  sausage breakfast sandwiches etc All of those types of establishments sell more than just coffee Most have some type of meateggcheese breakfast thing to go along with the coffee,neutral
Stay salty my friend there are a lot of David Wolfes out there,positive
Good thing I dont eat meat and I dont eat any of these places,negative
Best thing would be to not eat out,negative
there is no other places to eatforget that,negative
Its from the organic consumers Association you dipshitz LOL,negative
The source is the organic consumers Association dipshitz,neutral
The source is actually the organic consumers Association Not David avocado Wolfe FYI,negative
This  David Wolf is a hack,negative
Sabrina Abenheim  however they conflated their point by associating it with Wolfe had they actually just posted the original article and not posted his whackadoo meme with it it would ahve stood on its own,negative
When you say restaurant D D D,negative
Sarah Jones Jay Lundy Reagan,positive
While the source is not credible I wouldnt doubt if these places actually did have antibiotics in them Almost everyone in my family has worked at fast food places its a pig sty,negative
Sabrina tell me in your own words what Via David Wolfe means to you  Ill wait,negative
No lol it was the other way around,negative
You sure told me lol Ill remember your stringent approach to fact verification in the future,negative
Dunkin n Starbucks both offer sandwiches,positive
So youre saying Via David Wolfe means it came from OCA Huh,negative
Nowhere in this article does it link or list these restaurants  Does someone have a reliable link,negative
Eat Local Growns original post,positive
And who did they attribute this to And whose FB page is stamped on the bottom of the image Dont stop now  youre almost there Sabrina,negative
The original post was from eat local growns Then David avocado Wolfe posted it Get it now LOL,negative
Well all I really care about is where did the data come from Seriously lol,negative
Not without proof that what youre saying is true  Find me the original from Eat Local and show that it predates Avocado Boys post,positive
From everything Ive seen it comes from Avocado  Therefore most likely fake,negative
DO YOU SEE IT NOW,positive
Eat Local Grown shared Wolfes photo,positive
Live veganit solves many problems,negative
What Jewel said Sabrina Eat Local posted this on 131 They attribute it to Avocado Via therefore he had posted it PRIOR to them doing so  Doesnt time work the same way in your world D,negative
If you want to take the time and energy to sift through all the pseudoscience and BS on Avocados page and find when he posted it Im quite sure youll see it was BEFORE 1312018,negative
I do not follow him he is a whack job absolutely do not follow the guy hes nuts,negative
So have you figured out how time flows yet,positive
Lets just stick with the original poster who was the organic consumer Association okay And the fact that all that crap is not good for you how about that LOL,negative
Yes Todd I get how time flows thank you honey My bad,positive
Sabrina Abenheim and that is my point the article alone would have been fine,negative
They lessen their credibility by attaching said article to an image which are both basically unrelated,negative
Why do you think they are the original poster This was posted on OCA yesterday which is AFTER 131 when Eat Local posted it that is AFTER Avocado posted it,negative
I dont eat meat so Im not personally concerned about the crap they serve at fast food restaurants which I dont patronize,negative
Because the actual article linked doesnt even mention fast food,negative
Maybe Im not understanding what Sabrina means by original poster I take it to mean who posted the image perhaps she means the article which is unrelated to the image,negative
Dollar menu anyone I hear on Mondays they have big Macs 2 for the price of one,negative
Todd Tee  Yes she means the article,positive
Jewel Cavazos it does mention meat however so I think that is the correlation between the two,negative
The thing is how can these even be considered restaurants,negative
Wow  we should boycott these terrible businesses,negative
Blijft niet veel meer over dan,negative
Oh my gosh chick fil a i was thinking theres was good Ugh,positive
The only chain restaurant fast food Ive eaten in the last fifteen years is Taco Time Taco Time is freakin delicious But even as much as I like Taco Time I only eat there maybe twice a year I lost trust in the American food supply a long time ago I will never eat chicken again and beef is on the menu in only special circumstances,negative
How about avoid meat in general Youll never have to worry about antibiotics in your food again,positive

Yeh i never eat at any of these places food franchises are about,negative

Any Facebook page that used this Wolfe clown as a source should not be considered at all credible,negative
for shame justifying such practices how much does Monsanto pay you,negative
Oh no  Not Chick Fil A Darn,negative

Ask your restaurant where they buy their fooddo they know their farmerexcelentor do they buy from sisco no good,negative
Avery Cart Look at no 19,negative

And yet the chicken is processed in China  Eat organic onlym,negative
Starbucks I guess I only drink there mainly so thats ok,positive
Really now I call bullshit,negative
We would like to see the result of the actual test,positive
KFC is giant in China interesting but highly doubtful that all chicken is processed in China,negative
I seem to recall something about Chinese poultry being illegal into the us,negative
ATLANTACHICAGO Sept 15 Reuters  Major US poultry firms are administering antibiotics to their flocks far more pervasively than regulators realize posing a potential risk to human health,negative
I think you might be confused with growth hormones or did this change since 2014,negative

Guessing the heavy dairy has a lot of these on the list,negative
Well  So much for my husbands favorite places,positive
Is this true or just more fake FB posts   Cant trust anyone these days,negative

Katelyn Moreland looks like if you are sick you need to go out  eat Lol,negative
Maybe its more in North America than elsewhere in the worldthe size of the average person in NA due to poor food choices is astonishingas per health reports,negative
Ha This is practically everywhere u go to eat I guess we will be eating Perdue for the rest of our lifes,positive
Absolutely  We do have standards and regulations here too of course but its taken some time for the American consumer to get wise to the fact that industrialized agriculture actually puts the well being of the customer pretty much dead last in the equation  Over time however people have gotten wise to this and are starting to spend their money on wiser choices thus forcing the market to adapt  It wasnt long ago that if you said the words organic or non GMO etc you would have been looked at like some kind of a nut  Now even the average supermarket has organic choices even entire organic sections  Its not a specialty item anymore  Were still not as up to speed as the EU which has banned GMOs in everything altogether but were getting there,negative
the funny thing isorganic is just normal food as we had in our garden when I was a child and now its something special,positive
Me too  But thats only because my Grandparents had a Victory Garden during World War 2 when everything was rationed  They kept it up for years and years after,negative
Rowan Thomas I dont think America is broken American Government has been hijacked by a den of Corporate thieves but this problem isnt limited to America WHO and FAO are behind this 56 year plan Its not a secret,negative

Why would anyone eat at these shithole restaurant anyway  Disgusting crap,negative

Or maybe just go vegan lmao Taco Bell is lit with vegan options,negative
Thank gawd we can still get a good burger at Burgermaster or Dicks,positive

Human Rights Violation in Darjeeling,negative
As expatriate Indian citizens who belong to the Gorkha Community we are in great distress and anguish over what people in Darjeeling have been subjected to in the past few weeks The gross human rights violations that the peace loving Gorkha communities are facing are uncalled for and inhumane,negative
In a democratic country like India where diversity in culture language and religion are celebrated on a daily basis even the suggestion of forceful imposition of a second language over the mother tongue has been unheard of Which is why the implication that Bengali as a language would be imposed on all communities in Darjeeling District has been shocking,negative
For far too long the Gorkhas have been subjected to distressing and unacceptable proposals such as this causing violent and regular protests in these regions For us living in the United States far away from everything that we hold dear seeing the brutalities on TV and social media makes us feel helpless,negative
In the past few weeks three innocent bystanders have been killed and hundreds more have been injured during peaceful processions by the armed forces The atrocities by the state government have adversely impacted our tourism a major source of livelihood for people in Darjeeling In addition the State Government has successfully cut communication of all forms including transport to and from the entire district impacting hundreds of schools colleges businesses and even medical facilities,negative
Now politically backed goons are destroying and cutting off food supplies to the hills and no action has been taken on these people,negative
While India is actively promoting advancement of technology in the country through Digital India the Gorkhas have now lost freedom to access the Internet from 3 Jun 2017 The continuing apathy of the West Bengal government to the current situation does not surprise a Gorkha anymore because they have faced this for decades,negative

If you recalculate your memory you will come to know my father name his clinic was in Dharamghar and during your congress campaign he use to meet with you in Dharamghar not only this he wrote several letters to you for electricity in our village and ultimately after lot of efforts we facilitated with the electricity,positive
Now herewith I would like to submit here my two submissions in about the part of my Village ie Talara of Okhlisirodh These are as below,negative
The Road to Talara We are suffering lot due to non availability of Road to Talara As you know at the time of our former honorable Prime Minister Mr Atal Bihari Bajpai it was passed that each village and part of village must be connected with NHAI and main cities of State under the provision of Pradhanmantri Sarak Yojaja and Pradhanmantri Gram Vikas Yojana but the part of my village is still kept away from this facility Some time back Mr Bahadur Ram Tamta the former District commission of Delhi and MLA of congress got the road up to his house with the help of Mr Narain Dutt Tiwari the former Chief Minister of Uttarakhand and we are just 89 kilometer far from his house but the road not extended further because we dont have any approach to reach to the chief minister or prime minister so we kept out away from the facility Nobody is there who will listen to us several times we approached the block development officer through the Sabhapati but nothing happened Mr Gajat Singh on behalf of us meeting with these officials frequently but they are not doing anything So my submission to you is please allow the road which is as of now only up to Mr Bahadur Ram Tamta house to be extended further to my house and further to Shea the another village or to be connected with the Sheraghat Road,negative
My second submission is the water provision other village people with the help police facilitated with the water through our land the water facilitated to them through the line lined toward their village through our land and in between our village is there but they didnt gave a connection to us whereas used our land for the water and the water gone there from our forest so our submission is that please allow us a water connection from this line which is going the that village through our land For the same we fought lot but no action done Thanks with Regards,negative
herewith I am enclosing this mail to pmo office also because lot of fund already released for rod and village development and also during this budget session Mr Jately announced lot fund for Road connectivity for village To the and village development,negative
